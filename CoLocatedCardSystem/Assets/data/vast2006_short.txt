The Republican commission scolded the city board of elections for minimizing problems with the touch-screen machines that the city purchased this year for 1.5 million and asked Mayor Rex Luthor to investigate what went wrong before the machines are pressed into service again. Alderwood's touch-screen voting machines, which resemble laptop computers without keyboards, were supposed to simplify voting and tabulating results. But in a debut that mirrored many of the problems experienced last year in areas across the country, some voters found the machines confusing, and the reporting of vote tallies was delayed almost a day. Luthor responded that he would try to address the board's concerns. He said he has called for a public meeting of the three-member board of elections to go over the requests at 5 p.m. today. \"I pledge that I will answer every question as soon as I possibly can in the proper fashion,\" he said."}

A few of those individuals made very poignant arguments, however, the fact of the matter is this, for every city that has had a bad experience with privatization, there is another that has had a good experience. Now, I am not saying that I am either for or against privatization. What I am saying is that the citizens of Alderwood elected me to be their watchdog, to make sure that I make sound fiscal decisions when it comes to using the city's money. In order to do this, I need to be able to look at all aspects of the city's budget. This includes possible privatization. Good citizens of Alderwood, I will promise you this, whether or not I vote in favor of privatization, I will never vote for less quality or poorer standards regardless of the cost. /s/ John Sarducci, City Councilman, Alderwood Untruths about teachers don t help fix schools I have had the privilege of getting to know John Panni over the past couple of years in the capacity as a tennis and basketball coach. He does a great job covering our local teams and I find him very likable on a personal level. I was, however, disappointed at some of the things he said in his personal column titled \"Election night headache\" (11-3-04). I also voted against I-884 because I don't think throwing more money at the education problem is the answer. I would like to see the education system use existing money more effectively. In that sense I agree with Mr. Panni. However, Mr. Panni's discussion of teachers wanting more pay is very off base. He notes that teachers \"work a six-hour day, only work 180 days out of each year, and get to work with children.\" One part of that statement is true, we do get to work with children. This can be a great joy, but it can also be a tremendous struggle to have 150 kids that you are responsible for on multiple levels. As a teacher, I take issue with Mr. Panni's comments regarding teacher work hours. The contract for teachers in Alderwood requires that we be at work from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily. If my math is correct, that's seven and a half hours a day, not six. I don't know very many teachers who keep that schedule. Mr. Panni might want to look at the sign-in sheet at the high school, or others for that matter, so he can see the hours that teachers come in to do work for which they are not paid. As a teacher, a 50-hour work week is not uncommon. I have had many full time jobs in my life. Teaching is the most time consuming, mentally taxing and rewarding job of them all! When I got into this profession, money was not a deciding factor. I wanted to have time in the summer to spend with my family. What a dream that was! Not only is my summer taken up with preparing for the next school year, I am required by the state (at my expense) to increase my education. When do you think that is done? So why is there a teaching shortage in many parts of this country? The way Mr. Panni described it, you'd think everyone would want to teach. So, here is an open invitation. If being a teacher, advisor and mentor to 150 students daily on a 30,000 a year salary appeals to you, then this is a great job. Oh, you have to use your summers to continue your education on your dime (about 10,000 for me so far in my fourth year). I love my job and wouldn't trade it for any career. I chose it over law school because of my passion for it. It's just frustrating to read misconceptions like John Panni's, because teachers give their all to a system that has rules that they must live under. Fixing the system should be a priority, but promoting untruths about a teacher's job doesn't help. /s/ Troy Whittle, Alderwood High School social studies teacher Don t destroyour rec programs I was dismayed to hear that the city manager plans to eliminate the position of parks and recreation manager and divide the responsibilities of that job between the park supervisor and the secretary of the parks and recreation department. Do you believe these two individuals can handle their own duties, plus supervise the community center, museum, senior center, swimming pool, organize the children's soccer and baseball teams and organize the special craft and recreation programs for adults? As an example of one event, last year I volunteered to help with the summer track meet. There were 300 participants. This event was held on a Saturday. Would the parks and recreation secretary or park supervisor be able to organize and run all of these track events and also do their regular duties? The parks and recreation manager is responsible for the swimming pool programs, events at the senior center and the management of the sports leagues by assigning fields and organizing games. Will the department secretary and park supervisor be able to know what strokes should be taught in the different classifications of swimming classes? Besides their regular duties, will they be able to check on all the sports leagues and their field assignments and organize the league? Will they be present at the senior citizens casino night and participate as dealers? The citizens of Alderwood deserve a well organized recreational program that meets the needs of all ages. These activities provide outlets to many who would otherwise not have these advantages. When these programs decline, we will have more juvenile problems and associated negative behaviors. Please join me in opposing the decision of the city manager to destroy our progressive recreational program for all people in the city of Alderwood. /s/ Dorothy L. Aiken, Alderwood Steve Evanswill be missed The City of Alderwood will certainly miss Mr. Steve Evans, a long-time member of the police force. My family and I had the pleasure of meeting Steve when he came to St. Joseph's Hospital here in Tacoma to witness the birth of his first grandchild, Coven M. Evans Olivas. During his visit he spoke often of \"his town\" with great pride. He exhibited to the community he loved the same caring that he showed his oldest daughter during the difficult birth. His strength, kindness and love helped us all, and we join the City of Alderwood in their fond farewell. We will all miss him very much. /s/ Rosalinda and Ron Olivas, Tacoma Gubernatorial candidate offers thanks to voters Although the governor's race isn't yet decided, I want to take this opportunity to thank the readers of the Alderwood Daily News for their involvement in the democratic process, whether or not they voted for me. It was a long campaign, and I truly enjoyed getting to know the people of Washington. I also want to express my good wishes to Christine Gregoire and her family. No matter what the outcome of this race, I feel blessed to have had this wonderful experience. If I do win, I'll start putting in place my Forward Washington agenda to get our economy going again and help get people back to work. If I don't, I'll consider it one of the greatest honors of my life to have had the opportunity to run for our state's highest office. /s/ Dino Rossi Blood drawing very successful Sponsored by the Nouvella Club with Rita Blunk as chairperson, we had a very successful blood drawing on Nov. 2.

Russell, along with fellow VFW members Lyle Bergstrom and Dave Rodriguez, was on hand for the school's Veteran's Day ceremony. The men, who served as a color guard for the children's assembly, were later presented with certificates of appreciation from the students. The children also presented tokens of their respect and appreciation to a number of other Granger residents who served their nation in past wars. But the veterans weren't the only heroes honored during the assembly. A group of Granger High School girls were also singled out for their selfless deeds. \"The girls voluntarily cut their hair in order to provide human hair wigs for cancer patients suffering hair loss,\" said Janet Wheaton, Roosevelt Elementary School principal. Wheaton introduced the young women, who each allowed more than 10 inches of their hair to be sacrificed for the Florida-based charity. The girls, all members of the Granger High School Young Authors Club, decided to cut their hair at the suggestion of Emma Rice, whose grandmother died of cancer. \"We celebrate these girls and our veterans for all of their humanitarian acts,\" Wheaton said"}

But the title doesn't mean he will be seeing patients as a physician, he explains. \"I do, however, have a very extensive knowledge of drug therapy and will be of service to doctors and their patients in helping to monitor their medications,\" he explained. Nguyen, who has worked in the Alderwood Community Hospital pharmacy since 1996, recently earned his Doctorate of pharmacy from Idaho State University. He completed the two-year doctorate program over the course of four years, working as a part-time student while maintaining his job working with fellow hospital pharmacist Arie Van Wingerden of Alderwood. Nguyen, who came to America in 1987 from Vietnam, earned his pharmacy degree from St. John's University in New York State, before moving to the West Coast. Nguyen said since coming to America he has worked to be of value in society. \"It is the most important thing to me,\" he said. \"I took the opportunity to pursue an education so I could be of value to others,\" he said. In order to earn his doctorate, Nguyen had to take training, known as clerkships, outside of the classroom in six-week intervals. As a doctor of pharmacy, he doesn't actually prescribe medications to patients, but serves as a resource for physicians and hospital staff. With the additional training, Nguyen said he is now more qualified to aid physicians with drug therapy and drug monitoring. He said living in the Lower Valley suits his lifestyle. A Grandview resident, Nguyen said he worked in Seattle for about six months at a Payless pharmacy. \"I didn't like living in the city,\" he said. \"I wanted to work in a hospital in a rural setting.

{"Id":"1101162452967","Title":"Clown classes begin in Alderwood","Author":"Mel Sacher","Time":"11/9/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"Part of the next generation of clowns attended the first of several classes last night to learn the basics and secrets of how to become a clown. Monday night at the Alderwood Beauty Academy, Arlo Waggoner, who is also known to many as Waldo the Clown, started the class by showing the students a video by the Ringling Brother's Barnum and Bailey Clown College. The video covered the basics of what the students will be learning over the next several weeks as they delve into the clowning world. A form of entertainment that has been around for more than a thousand years, clowns were once known as court jesters. Waggoner said the first step is to learn how to move like a clown. While most people walk and move smoothly, clowns exaggerate their movements, which is important so that people know exactly how they are feeling. Although they will have time to practice later, the students also learned the basics of juggling, which includes starting out with something like a light handkerchief, which will fall slowly. Waggoner said as that becomes easier, begin trying with soft bean bags, which won't roll away if dropped. \"The bottom line is practice,\" said Waggoner. Last night's video also showed the basics of balloon art, clown gags and skits and designing costumes. The students also learned there are three different kinds of clown make-up faces, the white faced clowns, which are the more reserved clowns. Auguste clowns, which have both white and flesh tones, are the roust-abouts and trouble makers, said Waggoner. The third type of clown is the tramp or character clown. Clothes are determined by what kind of clown a person chooses to be. Waggoner said that if his students choose to be a tramp or character clown he wants them to dress nicely instead of in old rags. The key to developing a face and costume is to exaggerate already existing physical characteristics, such as height, length of face and girth. When developing a clown face, the basic circus colors used are red, black, white and blue. Clowns use color on their lower lip only and smiles are generally smaller, not the big scary smiles often created by inexperienced clowns, said Waggoner. Using baby powder, clowns set their make-up so it doesn't run. \"We use plain old baby powder as long as it doesn't have cornstarch in it,\" said Waggoner, adding that they brush off excess powder with a brush. \"After I get my make-up on I can go swimming and it won't come off,\" said Waggoner. The next class will be held Monday, Nov. 15, at the Alderwood Beauty Academy. They will be going over make-up at the next class. Waggoner said it's not too late to sign up for the free classes. The class is open to all ages"}
{"Id":"1101162453186","Title":"Hefty increase in Alderwood property tax rate OK'd","Author":"John Panni","Time":"11/9/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"Years of not raising property taxes has finally caught up with the City of Alderwood. In a 4-3 vote during Monday night's meeting, City Council members approved raising the 2005 property tax by 42 per thousand of assessed property value from the current rate. The new property tax for Alderwood residents will be 3.1334 per 1,000 of assessed property value, up from the 2004 rate of 2.71 per 1,000 of assessed property value. The approved property tax increase will raise an additional 195,556 for city coffers. The city will raise an additional 625,970 in General Obligation Bonds. The payments on the bonds are being made from when the city refinanced together the Law and Justice Center and the pool measures voters approved. Council was split on the matter, with Mayor Pro-tem George Greenway and Councilmen Tom Seeger and John Torch wanting to scale back the property tax increase to 3 per 1,000 of assessed property value. Mayor Rex Luthor, Councilwoman Jennie Angel and Councilmen Jim Sarducci and Raul Martinez took the collective stance that the city needs to do something to raise money to prevent further reductions in city services. But not everyone agreed with the thoughts of Council Monday night. Alderwood resident Bob Johnson said he felt Council should stick to past practices of not raising taxes. Johnson said that with the cost of living and water and sewer rates continually increasing, now is not the time to burden residents with an extra tax. Johnson told Council it will probably be seeing a lot of vacant homes in Alderwood if property taxes are raised. Carol Stone expressed concerns that Council was raising property taxes to pay for the 2.2 million purchase of Monson feedlot. Stone also said she didn't want to see property taxes raised because she felt it might encourage the city to spend additional money for items not needed. Bruce Epps scolded Council for what he perceived as a mismanagement of the city's budget. Epps said because Council hadn't raised property taxes in a number of years that it backed itself into a corner, where it had no choice but to do so Monday night. \"You have mismanaged the budget. You have overspent,\" said Epps. \"If you had done your jobs along the way, you probably wouldn't be at this point.\" Angel sided with some of the concerns expressed by residents, but felt the city had no choice but to raise property taxes. Angel said that when the city is dealing with a budget the size Alderwood has, Council has to make some tough decisions. \"We are at the point where we have to do something,\" said Angel. Luthor agreed with Angel, saying that if Council didn't approve the property tax increase the city would be faced with having to make more cuts to balance the 2005 budget. The mayor also explained the city receives minimal dollars from the property tax, with the county receiving a majority of the money. Torch said he wasn't in favor of property tax increases, but said there is a need to raise rates. Torch, though, said he would like to see the Council go back to 1998 rates of 3 per 1,000 of assessed property value for the property tax. Torch said he felt the city could \"hold the line\" and manage best what it has with his proposed rate. Martinez said he was approached by residents over the weekend who were concerned with the personnel cuts proposed for 2005. But, Martinez said he saw the need to raise property taxes to help pay for needed city services. \"We do have to provide the basic services to our community,\" said Martinez. Farmer agreed with Torch about his thoughts on taxes, saying he would also like to see the 3 rate. The mayor pro-tem said he felt the city has to do something to raise money to prevent further service cuts. He said Alderwood residents have been lucky for the past several years with seeing no property tax increases, while other communities haven't been as fortunate. He said the city has also taken money out of reserves to pay for mistakes that have been made by the county so as not to burden the local taxpayers. Farmer said he believes the city could be creative with how it uses city funds after receiving the money from the 3/10 of 1 percent sales tax county voters recently approved for law and justice services to address some budget matters. Seeger was quick to point out that the Monson feedlot purchase has nothing to do with the budget. Seeger said the money spent for the purchase of the Monson feedlot will be replenished as soon as the property is sold. Seeger was also in favor of raising property taxes to the 3 rate. He said he feels the city has been doing fine with providing services, citing what the fire department has been doing without having two staff members available"}

A tearful homecoming with family began about 4 p.m. when her sons arrived at her Grandview home. It had been a year since Martinez saw her oldest son, Sgt. Ismael Ramirez, 25, and six months since Specialist Job Ramirez, 24, had visited home, according to the brothers' sister, Socorro Ramirez. The brothers signed up for the Army two weeks apart. \"I kind of always wanted to be in the Army,\" said Job Ramirez, who was first to enlist. \"I was going to Eastern and after I stopped going to school I came home.\" A short time later he decided to sign up for a military tour. Scheduled to be released this coming spring, he recently re-enlisted. Ismael was attending law school at Willamette University when he decided to enlist in the Army. \"I realized I didn't want to be a lawyer,\" said the Washington State University graduate. \"You play with GI Joe's when you're little and you want to be in the Army,\" said Ismael. I also needed a way to pay off student loans.\" Both men are stationed out of Ft. June and recently returned from Iraq. Job has been in the states about a week and Ismael about four days. The Ramirez brothers each received a four-day weekend and decided to visit their mother and other family in the Lower Valley. They will be taking block leave in December, which will give them a month off. The two brothers are in the same Striker Brigade combination team, the 3rd Brigade of the Second Infantry Division. Both work in supply and were actually at the same camp in Iraq for a while before Ismael was promoted and moved about 50 kilometers away. \"Iraq is colder and rainier than everybody thinks it is,\" said Ismael, who added that they had two days of snow before he left Iraq. Stationed in the city of Mosul, which is a huge sprawling city, he said that although they are trained to work in supply, they, like other military personnel, had duties that aren't typical of supply officers. They often go on convoys into the city. \"All the cooks are guarding gates,\" said Ismael. Being in Mosul for a year, Ismael has seen differences made in the services to the military personnel, as well as the citizens of the city. He said the first three months they were there it was difficult without some of the amenities now offered, such as Internet cafes. Ismael has also seen improvements in city sanitation and sewage treatment because of work done by the U.S. military. He added that schools are also up and running again. Job believes the most important thing he's done since arriving in Iraq is what directly influences his unit. Returning home, the brothers came to the Valley to be surrounded by family and friends, whom they haven't seen in a while. Ismael came back to the states to his wife, whom he lives with in Renton. \"Once we're back it's like a regular day job,\" said Ismael. \"This is like a family reunion,\" said Socorro Ramirez. \"We were last together a year ago last July when my brother (Ismael) got married.\" One of her biggest fears is that now that her brother, Job, has re-enlisted, he will be required to go back to Iraq, although he believes he will have some time home before returning there"}

Mabton, which lost its first two league games of the season but bounced back to win six straight in conference play, will open the postseason against the Lind-Ritzville Broncos. The Vikings' first round State playoff opponent won the Northeast 'B' League with a perfect 9-0 record. Mabton (6-2, 7-3) enters the State playoffs as the No. 3 seed out of the Central Washington 'B' League. Mabton Coach D.J. Search said the site and date of his team's first round playoff game against Ritzville is not yet decided. He and the Ritzville coach have already swapped game films. Search said he is optimistic his club can give the Broncos a stiff challenge. \"They're not a bad team,\" Search said of the unbeaten Broncos. \"Speed wise, I think we match up pretty well with them. But I think we're going to be more physical than them.\" In knocking off Entiat last Friday, Mabton showed it is a team that is ready for the postseason. The Vikings not only ran the ball effectively, they also weren't afraid to put it up in the air. Mabton QB Ryan Harris completed 11-of-21 passes against Entiat, serving up only one interception while throwing for 174 yards. \"Those aren't bad numbers for high school football,\" said Search. \"Ryan is making good decisions on the field. He's progressively gotten better as the season has gone along,\" Search said. Harris' targets last Friday included Moises Gutierrez, who hauled in five passes for 77 yards. Gutierrez and Pablo Sanchez, who caught two passes for 32 yards and also rushed for 60 yards on 13 carries, each caught a touchdown pass from Harris. On the ground, Mabton tallied 309 yards against Entiat. Junior Ray Elizondo was the workhorse for the Vikes, taking 20 hand-offs from Harris and picking up a season best 167 yards. \"It was Ray's biggest game of the season,\" said Search, explaining that Entiat didn't adjust to Mabton's dives up the middle. \"So we just kept feeding the ball to Ray,\" he said. The reason Elizondo had so much room in the middle to run, said Search, was because of the play of the Vikes' offensive line. \"Our O-line did a great job of taking care of business,\" Search said. \"They played very hard.\" Mabton opened the scoring last Friday on a 5-yard TD pass from Harris to Sanchez in the first quarter. The Vikings increased their lead to 14-0 in the second period, on a 16-yard touchdown run by Alex Zavala, who carried the ball 11 times Friday night, tallying 59 yards in the process. After Entiat picked off a Harris pass, at Mabton's 22-yard line, the home team notched its only score of the night to draw to within 14-7. Mabton ended any suspense that might have been left, though, when the Vikings punched in a couple of TD's in the third quarter. Zavala and Sanchez scored on runs of 4 and 2 yards, respectively. Gutierrez's five-yard touchdown catch in the final quarter accounted for the final 35-7 score. Defensively, Search said his Vikes turned in another splendid performance. \"Other than Entiat's opening drive, when they got to our 4-yard line, and the one drive after they intercepted our quarterback, they never really challenged us again,\" said Search"}

The Pioneers claimed a 28-12 opening round District win over Grandview to earn the right to move on to the State playoffs. The Greyhounds (3-3, 3-6) saw their season come to a close. Grandview was poised several times to take the early lead on the Pioneers' home field, but three first quarter stops by Omak after the 'Hounds had driven the ball deep into Pioneer territory thwarted any such hopes. First year Grandview Coach Dustin Lamb said his club had three red zone scoring opportunities in the opening period. \"But on two of them we had dropped passes in crucial situations, and with the other we had a penalty that backed us up.\" Omak also snuffed a couple of other Grandview drives in the first half when the Pioneers came up with a pair of interceptions. The 'Hounds were forced into playing catch-up football after Omak posted three touchdowns in the second quarter. Two of the TD's came on passes, from Pioneer QB Cody Campbell to Brenden Kaermingk. \"They had us down 21-0 at the half,\" said Lamb. Neither club could muster much of anything in the third quarter. But in the final period of play, Grandview made a run at the Pioneers. The Greyhounds finally got on the scoreboard when their quarterback, Brandon Artz, hit running back Silas Hansen with a 24-yard scoring strike. Artz followed up the TD with another touchdown toss to James Vela, the second one a 22-yarder. The Artz to Vela hook-up cut Omak's lead to 21-12. The Pioneers didn't allow Grandview to get any closer, though. Omak put an insurance touchdown on the scoreboard to account for the final 28-12 score. The Greyhounds put up some decent numbers on offense, despite being limited to two touchdowns on the night. Rushing-wise, Grandview tallied 88 yards. Hansen got most of the yardage, gaining 63 yards on 17 carries. Frank Medina toted the ball six times and picked up 17 yards for Grandview, with James Vela totaling eight yards on three carries. Through the air, Artz was 19-for-35 for 176 yards. Vela grabbed 10 of Artz's passes and picked up 93 yards on the receptions. Hansen had three catches for 54 yards, with Kevin Concienne gaining 25 yards on four receptions and Medina hauling in two passes for four yards. The Pioneers tallied just over 350 total yards on the offensive side of the ball. In assessing his first year as coach of the 'Hounds, Lamb said he is pleased with how Grandview fared this season. \"We were in every game, with the exception of the East Valley and Othello contests,\" Lamb said. \"For our seniors, it was their second straight appearance in the District playoffs. \"I compliment our seniors for a good season, especially with having to learn new stuff this year. \"And, we played a lot of younger kids this season.

This year when the local drama students take to the stage they may be speaking Shakespearean language, but there will be no denying that the play is set in modern times. For the past two and a half months the more than 30 cast members have been working diligently, learning their lines and preparing to bring Romeo and Juliet to the stage. Drama teacher Maisy Sylling noted that she tries to incorporate a Shakespearean play into the high school's repertoire at least once every four or five years in order to challenge her students to learn the language. As for why she chose to do Romeo and Juliet this year, Sylling said that she feels it's a timeless story and one with which students can relate. However, she did decide to modernize the play a bit, replacing knives and swords with guns and holsters and 16th century garb with modern-day costumes. \"It's more powerful if it's set in present day,\" Sylling said, noting that it makes it easier for students to relate to. Sylling said those sitting in the audience will have a chance to see a show that will make them think about the challenges young people face, especially if they are in love. \"I think they will be wrapped up in the story and impressed by the talent of the high school students,\" she said. The cast of Romeo and Juliet is made up of about 30 students, with another 25 students working behind the scenes. Sylling said this season's play helped attract a lot of new students to the drama program. She noted that for Tony Magana, who will be playing Romeo, this marks the first time he has been on stage. In the past he has worked as a member of the crew. The role of Juliet will be played by Angela Marin. The play is set to take to the stage at 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, Nov. 12 and 13, and Saturday, Nov. 20. The cost of admission is 3 for students and senior citizens, and 5 for adults"}

Most of her career, Roberson has practiced out of a beauty shop on Seventh Street in Alderwood, but about four years ago when New Image moved to Edison Avenue, so did Roberson. Roberson and her sister, who lives in Yakima, are both certified electrologists. \"In our family we have people who have a lot of hair and you can't work on yourself, so when the opportunity came up we both took the classes,\" said the Mabton resident. \"It's a rewarding field,\" said Roberson, who finds a lot of satisfaction in helping women who are uncomfortable with facial hair or other problem areas. \"There are three times in life when women grow hair, puberty, pregnancy and menopause,\" she said. But Roberson's services are not only sought by women. Men wanting their hands or backs hairless also visit her, as do high school aged boys and girls and college students home on vacation. \"As of today, electrolysis is the only method of permanent hair removal that is recognized by the Food and Drug Administration,\" said Roberson. She said plucking, tweezing, creams, waxes and other methods of hair removal don't kill the follicle and instead draw more blood to the area where hair is removed, causing it to grow back thicker and darker. Although some people think that electrolysis is similar to a medical procedure, Roberson is quick to let all know that they are not medical persons, but she added it is not the \"back door business\" people used to think it was. \"We are not medical people ourselves, but we have a lot of medical people talk to us,\" said Roberson. She recently returned from an electrolysis conference in Las Vegas, where she heard from medical professionals on different things to look for on client's skin and was updated on new technologies. Roberson said she often sees or notices changes in moles that a client may not know about. Without diagnosing a skin problem, she may suggest that a client see their doctor about the condition. On a few occasions Roberson's suggestion to go to the doctor has proven to benefit her clients, who were found to have cancerous spots on their faces. Electrolysis by Linda is a second job for Roberson, who does quality control for Stadelman Fruit Company in Zillah. Her Alderwood office hours are in the late afternoon and evening by appointment. \"I give a free consultation to anyone interested,\" said Roberson. \"This is not like getting a shot,\" she tells her clients. \"I go along the hair follicle and use a high frequency heat machine to cook the hair from the inside out.\" Roberson said her clients keep her interested in continuing electrolysis. \"When I see my clients on the street walking with their head high, it makes me feel good,\" said Roberson"}

Bristow, who was the featured speaker at the Alderwood Kiwanis Club meeting Thursday morning, said those who walk into her office will see a shelf of toys, which is what she uses to combat stress and enjoy life, even while at work. A student of laughter and the art of mixing work and play, Bristow said that the Puritans and Protestants brought the idea that work is exhalted and laughter and fun is sinful. \"A lot of people have the belief that if they are laughing they are not working,\" she said. Over the past 10 or 15 years studies have shown that work environments that promote laughter and promote play can be effected on the bottom line, said Bristow. She said that laughter and play raise morale and promote better customer service. Business guru Robert Dolson said that if laughter and humor are accepted in the work environment employees will be rewarded for what they do and picked up after failure, Bristow said. She added that she believes there is a reason why the Chinese pictograph for the word busy is a combination of the two words heart and killing. Bristow said that no one remembers their first laugh, which come when babies are about 10 weeks of age. By 16 weeks of age, babies laugh once an hour, even though they don't have a sense of humor, which is cultural, intellectual and learned. By the time a child is four or five years old they laugh or have positive facial reactions 400 to 500 times a day, said Bristow, who holds a Master's degree in counseling. \"A child knows it's good to laugh,\" she said. In a study of adults in work and non-work situations, adults laugh or smile 15 to 100 times a day. The majority of adults fall in the lower end, she added. \"They found that adults truly do not laugh or have positive facial reactions as often as children,\" she said. \"Your body loves it when you laugh or smile. Even the act of smiling can have a positive impact on the body.\" Bristow explained that there are other benefits to laughing including the release of natural chemicals in the body, which can reduce stress and act as a natural painkiller. She added that if someone wants to learn something they should laugh when they are trying to take in the information. Laughter is also a good way to exercise the lungs and promote creativity. \"As adults why don't we laugh more?\" Bristow asked. \"We're told 'life is not a laughing matter', 'this is serious', 'this is a dog eat dog world',\" she said. \"Laughter is the greatest connection between two people,\" she said. People who can laugh easily and laugh well show confidence and self-esteem. \"Usually if they laugh together the relationship is good,\" said Bristow. Besides laughter, Bristow suggests reframing things and looking at them from a different perspective, which can promote laughter. She said a person in special education once told her, \"I never thought I was a slow learner, I just thought teaching came very hard to my instructors.\" Even with the tips to keep laughter alive, Bristow said that one of the best ways she has to promote laughter in herself is to keep her toys in her office. She said she has a magic wand, bubble gun, books and a ball that when thrown on the ground sounds like smashing glass, which she uses when she's really upset"}

Greenway wants to enter into discussions with the school district to find a way to take back operation of the Alderwood Public Library from the Yakima Valley Regional Library System. \"We should look at some kind of joint venture between the city and the school district,\" said Greenway. The Alderwood City Council opted during budget discussions last year to put before local voters the issue of whether or not to support an additional 50 per thousand assessed property value tax to keep the library open under the operation of the Yakima Valley Regional Library. Voters approved that tax earlier this year. Council members then relinquished control of the library to the county-wide system. The regional library system is set to take control of the Alderwood library at the beginning of 2005. Greenway suggested the partnership with the local school district because he said he feels city residents will be shortchanged by the regional library system. Greenway said the financial figures regional library officials are releasing show that Alderwood residents are paying more into the system than they are getting. \"I think we can take that same 50 and do just as good or better,\" said Greenway. Councilwoman Jennie Angel, who is involved with the Alderwood Library Board, said regional library officials do have a plan in place to improve the local facility. Angel said she would like to see them given the opportunity to improve the facility before any talks of taking back the library happen. Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones didn't rule out such a discussion between the district and the city. Bones did caution there would have to be some changes made in the materials offered at the library if the district managed the facility because of the youths who would use it. .

{"Id":"1101162470201","Title":"School district, city at odds on needed infrastructure upgrade","Author":"John Panni","Time":"11/5/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"One thing can be gathered from Thursday night's joint meeting between the Alderwood City Council and the Alderwood School Board-communication has been lacking between the two entities. The lack of communication centers around the costs and design of infrastructure improvements for the new middle school the district is building along Washout Road. At the center of the discussion is a disagreement between the district's engineers and the city's engineers on what is needed to install water and sewer lines in the area. The district has an option that would save taxpayers some 300,000, but this would involve the installation of a 10-inch water main. The city, though, requires that all developments install a 12-inch water main with no exceptions. Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones backtracked and went over some of the history of how the district selected the property on Washout Road. He said when it was decided the district would purchase property, a committee was formed to look at different parcels. The committee included two former City of Alderwood employees. One of the first options was building a new school behind Pioneer Elementary. Bones said the district also looked at property along Mabton Highway, but finally decided on the Washout Road property after receiving a good bid. Bones said all together the district looked at 11 or 12 pieces of property to build the new school, including areas near the airport and on Cemetery Road. Bones said the district will be building a new middle school, which is set to begin construction this spring, to help meet the increased enrollment expected. Currently, the district serves 5,700 students with the figure expected to rise to 6,200 in the next three to four years. On the same property along Washout Road, the district will be building a new elementary school after it completes construction of the middle school. Councilwoman Jennie Angel said she wished the district had looked more at properties the city had that has infrastructure in place. School board member Fred Kilian interjected, saying one of the reasons the district picked the property was that it was told the city would be annexing property out in that area as the city continues to grow. Some confusion arose when Councilman John Torch stated that he thought the issue concerning the installation of water mains had been solved by the engineers, apparently to the blind eye of the school district. Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford elaborated on Torch' comments, saying that in a meeting he sat in on, both sides were able to bring the costs of installation for water and sewer lines down with some creative designs. \"What looked like a barrier was really being driven by costs,\" said Rockford. Rockford changed the subject briefly and said the city is looking at applying for a Community Development Block Grant next year to help with some of the expenses for covering the irrigation ditch in the area. He said the district and the city will have to also look at the traffic impacts in the area. Rockford, though, cautioned the school board members that it is very important that the city and the district work together on the project. He said the partnership will help secure such needed things as grants to lower the costs to taxpayers. Rockford also encouraged better communication between the city and the district when it comes to talking about traffic impacts. He said the same lack of communication that took place with infrastructure can't happen again. \"We got past this one because we started talking creatively,\" said Rockford. Wells, though, understood the city's point on not budging from its requirement of a 12-inch main, but said the job of the school board is to try and save patrons dollars. Wells said he would like to see the city open to other options with the installation of infrastructure. Rockford disagreed with Wells, saying he would not ask the city to budge from its requirements. Rockford said no developer coming into the community would ask the city to change its infrastructure requirements. Bones added that he wasn't aware that any matter had been settled in regards to infrastructure. Bones said he sees a difference of 300,000 in infrastructure costs between what the district and the city is proposing. School board member Fred Kilian said he can remembering seeing maps brought forth by former city employees that said infrastructure installation for the school project would work. \"I am not going to argue about who said where and when,\" said Kilian. \"All I am saying is I better get the damn thing (school) built before you have a new engineer.\" Mayor Rex Luthor suggested that Bones and Rockford sit down and negotiate an agreement between the two sides, settling all the issues for the project on which both sides can agree. .

{"Id":"1101162470717","Title":"Guest Editorial","Author":"Webmaster","Time":"11/5/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"SAM BOSTAPH Washington, D.C. will soon begin construction of a new taxpayer-funded baseball stadium at an estimated cost of 400 million, give or take 50 million. Thirty-three years after the Washington Senators left town to become the Texas Rangers, a majority vote of the D.C. city council will fill the vacancy by providing the former Montreal Expos the stadium that Montreal voters denied them. Touting the project, Mayor Anthony Williams of Washington claims that the revenue bonds that will be issued to build the stadium will be paid off completely by a lease payment of 15 million a year, by taxes on facility revenues, and by socking large businesses in D.C. with a new tax. Coincidentally, about two and a half hours away by air is Arlington, Texas, home of the former Senators, now the Texas Rangers, and the scene of another new stadium proposal. Local voters are being urged to approve a similar deal to build a football stadium to house the Dallas Cowboys just next door to the existing Rangers' stadium. The subsidy request comes from Jerry Wells, the owner of the Cowboys. The requested Arlington-taxpayer subsidy is estimated by the city's treasury manager to be about 600 million, including interest. New taxes are necessary to get the money. Local politicians in Arlington are trying to sell the deal to voters with the same promises D.C. officials made: lease payments to the city, jobs, redevelopment of surrounding areas, and higher revenues to local businesses. The job and multi-million-dollar local-business revenue projections all come from a study, funded by the Cowboys, that treats every dollar of revenue and every job created as new. This ignores the fact that since the new Cowboys stadium will be only a few miles away from the old one, current workers at the stadium will not have to move their homes or their spending and that construction employees will only be temporary. Also, the revenue projections are based on projections of future game attendance and other uses of the stadium that could easily prove wrong, and they ignore the \"distribution effect\" money spent on game attendance is money not spent on other entertainment and recreation. What about the lease payment? In contrast to D.C., the city of Arlington will receive an insultingly meager 2 million a year in rental fees and 5 percent of the money paid for the naming rights to the stadium, up to a ceiling of 500,000 annually. Obviously, the total won't even cover the interest payment on the bonds. Taxpayers will be out the principal and most of the interest. Wells has offered to throw in another 16.5 million for \"youth programs,\" to pay the local school district the revenue it would lose from any private property seized by the city for Wells's use, and to bribe local minority groups with discriminatory minority set-asides. If the proposed stadium subsidy is not a shrewd investment opportunity for Arlington, then what is it? Economists refer to such programs as \"transfer programs\" or, more honestly, \"business welfare\" programs. Money is taken from taxpayers, and real property is condemned, so that it can be transferred to those held in higher favor by public officials. In a word, thievery. This is most blatant in the plans to seize the property of those living south of the proposed building site. Wells and local politicians propose to milk taxpayers and steal property to benefit Wells, subsidize football fans, favor businesses near the stadium, and provide local politicians with another costly monument to boosterism next to the one that was built for the Rangers. The same sorts of promises that were made to voters to build the Rangers' stadium are being made once again. In the case of the Rangers, the results failed to match the hype. The stimulus to land development around the park failed to materialize and the park itself sits empty most of the year. There is one substantive difference between the Washington, D.C., situation and that in Arlington, Texas. In D.C., voters replaced three pro-ballpark council members with three opposed to the scheme; but the new members don't take office until after December 31. Mayor Williams and the majority of the old council are rushing to approve the issuance of revenue bonds before then in an end run around voters. The Arlington council occupies a higher ground. The proposal itself was put to voters on November 2. Lacking their approval, the deal is dead in the water. It should be.

The Grizzlies ended their year with a lopsided 31-14 loss last night to 2A Naches, which was the number five seed out of the Central Washington Athletic Conference. Alderwood Coach Mark Marro didn't offer any great excuses for the loss. \"We just didn't play real well,\" said Marro. \"They (Naches) came out fired up.\" Marro said the Grizzlies have been in a bit of a downslide since having to go into Ellensburg only at half strength with its roster. Marro said it has been hard for his team to get out of the mode. \"We really dropped at the end of the year,\" said Marro. \"It is difficult to keep that intensity level.\" Marro said the last game of the season was also difficult for his team because there wasn't much left to play for, with the Grizzlies being out of the playoffs. After a scoreless opening quarter, the Grizzlies pulled ahead 7-0 when Greg Gilleland dashed in from five yards out. Naches, though, answered back, scoring with about 30 seconds left in the first half. Alderwood took a 7-6 lead into the break. Naches went wild in the second half on the Alderwood defense, scoring 25 unanswered points. \"We gave up a couple of deep balls and that just gave them life,\" said Marro. Alderwood's last touchdown of the year came in the fourth quarter when quarterback Tony Cantu hooked up with Noe Zamarron on a 21-yard touchdown pass. The Grizzlies posted mediocre statistics in the game. Cantu was 4-of-11 in the game for 79 yards. Gilleland had eight rushes for 49 yards. Marro said Naches' defense did a great job of stopping Alderwood's rushing game. The Rangers also put together an effective ground attack, spreading the ball around between three players for nearly 150 yards. \"They were faster than us,\" said Marro. \"They had the best game of their season.\" Alderwood finished its season with a Mid-Valley League record of 2-4, good for fifth place.

It is also a day when voters get a chance to voice their opinion on the fate of various ballot measures. This year the ballot measures gave voters a chance to decide on the fate of everything from the presence of electronic scratch tickets at licensed non-tribal gaming establishments to the creation of an education trust fund in the state. Tuesday, voters came out in force and let their feelings be known. Initiative 872 When it comes to the creation of a new primary election format, Washington voters overwhelming voted for change. In Yakima County, 67.8 percent of voters approved the initiative. This mirrors the response from voters across Washington state, where 59.9 percent voted for the initiative. The initiative gives voters a chance to vote for all candidates in a primary election with the top two candidates moving on to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. Those opposed to the initiative were concerned that the two-top primary could result in a single party election in some races come November. According to the State of Washington Voters' pamphlet, the passage of I-872 could mean lowering the annual cost of the primary election system by as much as 6 million from the system currently in place. Initiative 884 Initiative 884 asked voters to approve the creation of an education trust fund by increasing the sales tax across the state by 1 percent. This was a measure voted down by voters yesterday. In Yakima County, 60.59 percent of voters voted against I-884. These numbers nearly mirror the results statewide, where 60.74 percent of voters decided against the initiative. Those against the initiative pointed to the fact that Washington is already the seventh highest taxed state in the nation and already has one of the highest sales tax rates. Those for the initiative felt it would help provide additional funding for the state's education system. If the measure had passed it would have increased the state sales tax, which currently sits at 7.5 percent, by 1 percent. This new revenue would have been put aside to help support education throughout the state. According to the Washington State Voters' pamphlet, it would have provided additional funds for K-12 schools, as well as pre-school assistance for low income children and post-secondary education. Initiative 892 Tuesday, voters flexed their muscles and voted down Initiative 892, which dealt with electronic scratch ticket machines. The initiative would have made it possible for authorized, licensed non-tribal gambling establishments to bring in the same type of gaming machines used at tribal casinos. According to the initiative, the revenue brought in from the additional gaming machines would have been used to reduce state property taxes. In Washington state, 60.63 percent of voters marked no on their ballots, leading to the defeat of the measure. In Yakima County, results were very similar with 60.17 percent of voters against the initiative. Referendum Measure 55 The second education measure on the ballot didn't fare much better than the first. Tuesday, voters in Washington voted down Referendum Measure 55, which would have made it possible to establish charter schools in the state. The measure would have made it possible for charter schools to be operated by \"qualified non-profit corporations, under contracts with local education boards.\" The charter schools would have been allocated a certain amount of public funds for operation. Again, the percentage of voters who voted against Referendum 55 in Washington state is almost exactly the same as the percentage of those who voted against it in Yakima County. Across the state, 58.42 percent of voters voted against the measure. In Yakima County, 58.77 percent of voters voted against it. Jim Spady with the Washington Charter School Resource Center noted that he feels the Washington education system is currently in crisis. \"We must do more to help our educationally disadvantaged students,\" Spady said. \"Charter public schools will help these children, but the voters have apparently decided to give the regular public school system more time to solve this crisis on its own.\" Initiative 297 One measure voters across the state turned out to support was Initiative 297, which deals with radioactive hazardous waste at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. The initiative adds new previsions concerning the waste, making it necessary for the waste that is at the site to be cleaned up before any more waste can be brought into the facility. In Yakima County, 61.66 percent of voters voted for the measure, compared to 68.51 percent who approved it across the state. Proposition No. 1 Locally, Yakima County voters approved Proposition No. 1, which called for a three-tenth's of a penny increase in the county's sales tax to help fund the area's criminal justice system. The proposition will be in effect for a six-year period before it is brought back to the voters. Throughout Yakima County, 56.04 percent of voters voted for the proposition. The proposition is expected to raise 6.1 million annually for the Yakima County criminal justice system, with the funds being dispersed to law enforcement agencies throughout the county"}

Bueno is a classroom assistant with the EPIC childhood education program in Alderwood. His duties as a classroom assistant means he helps the head teacher prepare for each school day. EPIC provides pre-school services to children ages 3-1/2 to 5 years old. Bueno said EPIC tries to fill the program with older children first and then if it can't it turns to the younger applicants. Bueno must really enjoy his job because he has been doing it for 14 years. \"I first started as a volunteer,\" he said. \"Then I applied for an open position.\" What keeps Bueno at his job? \"I enjoy the interaction I have with the children and the families,\" said Bueno. \"That is what has kept me there.\" Besides the children, Bueno said the best part of going to work is being around his co-workers. \"It is kind of like my home away from home,\" said Bueno. \"The environment is very friendly.\" Just how many children has Bueno dealt with over the last 14 years? Bueno took some time to count some of his past pupils and came up with 564 children he has helped prepare for the public school system. Bueno said his favorite part of seeing former students is being able to look at the progress each child has made. \"Looking at them makes me feel old,\" laughed Bueno. When he is not at work, Bueno is busy taking care of his family. Bueno and his wife, Betty, have three children, Devina, 6, Emilio, 3, and Jonathan, 1, with another child on the way.

Bueno will have an Associate's degree in pre-school education with an option in special education. Bueno then plans to obtain a Bachelor's degree in education. \"My goal in life is to either work with pre-school children or be a kindergarten teacher,\" said Bueno. Bueno said what he enjoys about working with younger children is that they use their imagination in learning. If there was a hard part to his job, Bueno said it is saying goodbye to the children at the end of each school year. \"I always feel like we have accomplished a lot in our nine months working with the kids,\" said Bueno.

Nethercutt began a whirlwind tour of Washington state Monday morning, which included an 11 p.m. stop in Alderwood, as he tries to become the first senator from the east side of the state in 82 years. \"I am going to be that senator. I have the right values,\" Nethercutt told a large crowd gathered outside of The Outpost convenience store Monday night. \"We are going to bring strong leadership to the United States Senate because you deserve it.\" But to become the first senator from Eastern Washington in more than 80 years, the Spokane Republican will need all the votes he can get on this election day to unseat Democrat incumbent Patty Murray. \"We are not quitting until we win this election,\" said Nethercutt, as he deboarded one of two chartered buses filled with campaign supporters. \"I want everybody in the state to know I want to win this election,\" said Nethercutt. Even though Nethercutt is an underdog in his campaign to unseat Murray, it is not the first time the congressman has had his back against the wall. In 1994, Nethercutt pulled off a stunning political upset of Tom Foley, who was speaker of the House of Representatives at the time, for the Washington's fifth congressional district seat. It was the first time since 1860 that a sitting speaker of the house had lost a re-election campaign. Nethercutt, who was heading to his next stop in Yakima, encouraged the crowd in Alderwood to go out and talk with their neighbors about his campaign and what he can bring to Washington residents. \"I am not worried about polls. I am not worried about editorials,\" said Nethercutt. \"I am worried about the people who go out to vote.\" Nethercutt told the crowd that it is time for a change in the United States Senate. \"Patty Murray never comes here,\" said Nethercutt. \"Patty Murray is a sad incumbent.\" Nethercutt went over some of the issues his campaign is standing on as it looks to garner enough supporters to unseat Murray. Nethercutt said he is in favor of cutting taxes, supporting the troops fighting the war overseas and medical liability reform. Nethercutt said Murray has voted against all those issues while in the Senate. Nethercutt ended his stop in Alderwood by encouraging people to go out and vote for him and other Republican candidates. Nethercutt also left the crowd in Alderwood with one promise if elected to the Senate. \"This won't be the last time you see me in Alderwood,\" said Nethercutt"}

Whether she is talking about organizing candlelight poetry readings for her reluctant teenage poetry students or spending her lunch hours teaching a senior how to read, Steen oozes the passion she feels for her job as a Mabton High School English teacher. Her enthusiasm, as well as her novel approach to the dreaded, but necessary language arts, has earned the 22-year teaching veteran the state's highest education honor. Late last week, Steen was named Washington's \"Teacher of the Year.\" Steen, along with Mabton High School Principal Keith Morris and Mabton School District Superintendent Dr. Sandra Pasiero-Davis, traveled to Seattle, where Steen thought she was to be recognized along with eight other regional teachers of the year. Her surprise at being named the state's top educator continues to stun the woman, who is never at a loss for words. \"I'm still overwhelmed at the honor,\" Steen said yesterday (Monday) at a press conference held in her honor at the Mabton High School library. \"I'm happy to be the recipient of this award,\" she said. \"I truly believe there is no greater job than being a teacher,\" she added. Steen credited her fellow teachers, as well as her students, for making her job exciting and rewarding every day. \"It's frequently frustrating, but absolutely never boring,\" she laughed. Steen, who began her career teaching seventh and eighth grade English, has taught high school English for the past 11 years at Mabton High School. This year she was selected as the Mabton School District's literacy coach. She has taught all levels of students, from remedial to advanced placement English, a program she helped to establish for the Mabton School District. Steen is a teacher who lives near her students and frequently invites them into her home for socials, which from time to time involve mystery theater dinners. She demonstrates and uses her talent for inspiring others to adapt to the educational process, say her contemporaries. \"I've been impressed with Tamara's ability to acknowledge all of her students with humor, style and love,\" said Pasiero-Davis. \"We are part of a team,\" Steen explained. \"Every year, I claim I have the best students I've ever had. And I do every year,\" she added. \"I knew when I was eight that I wanted to be a teacher,\" Steen said. \"I love it and think teaching is the best job in the world,\" she said. Her students also appreciate the love she brings to the classroom. \"I've looked forward to being in her classes all my life,\" said long-time Mabton native Katie Beeman, one of Steen's high school English honors students. \"She makes class fun and exciting, and material we don't understand she acts out to make it easier to understand and interesting,\" Beeman said. \"She always finds a way to help us understand,\" agreed Alida Mendoza, who also is one of Steen's English honors students. \"Her class is hard, but she makes us understand. We know she could go anywhere to teach. But she sticks with us,\" Mendoza said. As the state's teacher of the year, Steen will find that she will have to be out of the classroom. \"She will be traveling a lot this year, as an education ambassador to Olympia to talk with legislators, and to other districts to share her special brand of teaching talents,\" said Pasiero-Davis. \"She will travel to Huntsville, Alabama to visit a NASA space camp. Tamara will also be going to Washington, D.C. to represent Washington at the National Educator of the Year awards program,\" Pasiero-Davis added. \"I have eight essays to write in order to compete for that honor,\" Steen added. \"It's a good thing I like to write,\" she laughed"}

The weekend got underway Friday morning when Grandview police dispatchers received a call that a black Honda Civic had been stolen from the 400 block of West Fifth Street, according to Grandview Police Officer Mark Ware. Ware said the vehicle, which reportedly had two occupants, eluded the combined efforts of the Grandview police, Washington State Patrol and Yakima County Sheriff deputies, before being abandoned at a crash scene. The car thieves were headed west on Forsell Road, when the missed a curve at Puterbaugh Road before crashing into a fence near Stover Road and I-82, Ware explained. The two suspects fled the scene on foot and officers were unable to get a description of the suspects, Ware said. Two burglaries reported within minutes of each other on Friday evening found that someone had broken into an apartment building in the 900 block of West Second Street, where the walls were vandalized with gang-related graffiti, Ware explained. However, in the second reported burglary in the 500 block of Avenue \"H\", two male juveniles, 14 and 15, were apprehended and taken into custody on suspicion of breaking and entry, vandalism and malicious mischief. They were taken into custody. Ware said charges against the two males were sent to Yakima juvenile authorities. Sunday morning, a vehicle prowl near Division Avenue resulted in the theft of a car stereo from one vehicle, while a would-be thief in the 100 block of Arikara Drive was scared away when the owner of the vehicle surprised him. \"The descriptions for the suspects in both cases were again sketchy, \" said Ware. \"We're not sure if the two vehicle prowls are related,\" he said. A burglary at a storage unit in the 100 block of Wine Country Road was reported later Sunday morning. According to the police report, the break-in resulted in the theft of a bike.

But lose this coming Friday night, and the Mabton High School football team will have to hold its breath to see if it qualifies for the postseason. The Vikings are on the cusp of advancing to the playoffs thanks to this past Friday's dominating 53-8 victory over the Soap Lake Eagles. The win pushed Mabton's Central Washington 'B' League record to 5-2. Mabton will close out the regular season on Entiat's home field this coming Friday. Entiat's playoff hopes are barely alive, meaning that they have to beat Mabton and then hope for an upset or two from a couple of other teams in their league to advance. The bottom line, said Mabton Coach D.J. Search, is that his Vikes need to knock off Entiat this coming Friday. \"They'll be the best passing team we've faced this season,\" Search said. \"And, they're coming off a really big win against Pateros.\" Search said his club won't do anything out of the ordinary to shut down Entiat's prolific passing game. \"It will be assignment football as usual,\" he said. \"We'll stick with our basic game plan.\" That may serve the Mabton football team well. Especially considering what the Vikes did to visiting Soap Lake this past Friday. Namely, Mabton limited the Eagles to just 95 yards of total offense. Offensively against Soap Lake, the Vikings had their way with the Eagles. By the time the second quarter rolled around, Mabton had already built a 33-0 lead. For the most part, the game was over. Search substituted freely after the opening quarter, allowing all of his younger players to get playing time. \"Our younger kids got lots of varsity experience last Friday,\" he said. Scoring-wise for Mabton, the Vikes' defensive unit was responsible for 8 of the 53 points. Marco Pineda blocked a Soap Lake punt in the first quarter and recovered the loose pigskin in the end zone for a touchdown, and Jesus Diaz sacked the Eagles quarterback in the end zone for a fourth quarter safety. On the offensive side of the ball, Mabton's Alex Zavala ran in two TD's. The first came on a 12-yard burst and the second touchdown was a 43-yard breakaway run. Mabton QB Ryan Harris was responsible for two touchdowns, as well. He tossed a 36-yard scoring strike to Pablo Sanchez, Harris' only throw of the game, and he danced in from 14 yards out on a quarterback keeper. Scoring one touchdown apiece for the Vikings, all on runs, were Eli Perez, Ray Elizondo and Ramon Castillo. Zavala had the most carries in the game against Soap Lake, rushing the ball six times for 68 yards. Sanchez added a 46-yard rushing effort on four totes"}

Friday night's loss marks the second week in a row that the Grizzlies have been shut out. Alderwood lost 20-0 at Ellensburg the previous week. Alderwood (2-4, 4-5) will be looking to end the 2004 season on a bright note this Thursday night, as the Grizzlies host 2A Naches. Friday night's game against the Vikings wasn't played as badly as the final score might indicate. Going into the second half, the Vikings had a mere a 14-0 lead following a late second quarter touchdown. In the second half, the Vikings used a strong ground game to rack up three touchdowns to account for the final score. The last touchdown by the Vikings came on a 72-yard burst by Rowan Ringer late in the game. Marro offered few excuses for his team's performance on Friday night. \"We just didn't get off the ball,\" said Marro. \"They (Selah) controlled the line of scrimmage.\" The Grizzlies did manage to threaten inside Selah's 20-yard line a few times, said Marro, but the drives ended up self destructing. Marro said in the second half Selah simply was overpowering. \"They physically got after it,\" said Marro. \"We came out flat. They (Selah) just took it to us.\" Marro said Alderwood had several players who put forth a strong individual effort, but the team chemistry wasn't flowing enough to keep up with how Selah was playing. Alderwood's Greg Gilleland nearly had a 100-yard rushing night, gaining 95 yards on 21 carries. Teammate Joe Schwartz had 25 yards on eight totes. The Vikings did most of their damage on the ground, as Ringer ran for 132 yards on just 10 carries. Marro is looking to end the season strong this Thursday night at home against Naches. The Grizzlies will have an opportunity to finish .500 for the season with a win over the Rangers. \"They are a good team,\" said Marro. \"We are going to have to get after it"}

Alderwood police officers responded to a shooting incident at 713 South Fourth Street on Thursday afternoon, according to Alderwood Police Officer Jim Ortiz. Ortiz said the initial call had officers responding to an attempted break-in at the residence. Alderwood Police Chief Ted Mana confirmed the name of the victim at the scene Thursday afternoon as Nala Hernandez. Ortiz said that officers arrived at the scene to find Hernandez with a gunshot wound to her forehead. \"It is tragic,\" said Ortiz. \"It was something that could have been prevented.\" Ortiz said the incident is even more tragic since Hernandez had only turned 11 years old on Oct. 22. Hernandez was transported to Alderwood Community Hospital. She was later taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where she died later in the evening. Ortiz said Hernandez and her 16-year-old brother and 14-year-old cousin were not in school. The place where the incident occurred is the residence of the 14-year-old cousin, said Ortiz. It is believed Hernandez was shot in the forehead with a small caliber handgun by her cousin, said Ortiz. Ortiz had limited information on the case this morning as it is being handled by the detective unit within the Alderwood Police Department. The initial report given by the two boys is that someone was trying to break-in to the residence. That report was proven wrong upon further questioning, said Ortiz. Ortiz said Hernandez's cousin was taken into custody and is currently being held at the Yakima County Juvenile Detention Center. Hernandez's 16-year-old brother is not in custody. According to representatives of the juvenile division of the Yakima County Prosecutor's Department, Hernandez's cousin was to have had a preliminary hearing today (Friday) at 1:30 p.m. The cousin has not officially been charged yet, according to officials at the prosecutor's office. Prosecutors did say the Alderwood Police Department has requested first degree manslaughter charges against the cousin. In response to the incident, the Alderwood School District implemented its lockdown protocol. John Hughes, director of safe and effective schools, said each building went into lockdown sometime between 1:30 and 2 p.m. Under the lockdown procedures, students were confined to the school buildings. Hughes said the district has had such protocol in place for the past three years, as part of its crisis management plan. \"We just react to situations as we feel is necessary,\" said Hughes. Hughes said in such cases as yesterday's shooting the district implemented the lockdown to ensure the safety of district students.

{"Id":"1101162505139","Title":"Initiatives, referendums topic of local GOP meeting","Author":"Mel Sacher","Time":"10/29/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"State legislators Sen. Jim Honeyford and Representatives Dan Newhouse and Bruce Chandler spoke to the Alderwood Republican Club Friday morning regarding the initiatives and referendums on the ballot this year. Honeyford started off the discussion taking about Referendum 55, which, if passed will allow charter schools in Washington state as a five-year pilot project. The issue, which was passed 27 to 22 in the Senate and 51 to 46 in the House, would allow the establishment of 45 charter schools in the state. According to Honeyford, if the initiative is passed new charter public schools will be opening in the state. He added that these are not religious or private schools, but public schools, which will fall under fewer regulations than the other public schools in the state. Based on what has occurred in other states that have developed a charter school program, 13.7 percent of the students attending these schools come from home schooling, religious or other non-denominational schools. A vote to pass the initiative would approve it as the legislators originally passed it, said Honeyford. Supporters of the charter schools, which are non-profit public corporations, would be responsible for raising the initial start-up costs. There are federal grants specifically for charter schools, said Honeyford. In addition, roughly 7,000 a year per student would be allocated to the schools from the state, which is money that would have otherwise gone to the public schools. \"I don't believe that takes any money away from the public schools because it is no longer their responsibility to educate that child,\" said Honeyford. The schools will be required to take any students who apply, no mater if they have language issues, are on free or reduced lunch programs or have a learning disability. \"I view this as a way to encourage and get more students to graduate,\" said Honeyford. \"This is a big issue in Western Washington. I suspect there would be very few in Eastern Washington.\" He added that he believes that there needs to be a way to give parents another option in a district that is not doing a good job. Besides new charter schools, the law would provide that one or all schools in a district could become a charter school. The I-892 gambling issue is another that will go before voters. The initiative is designed to try and level the playing field between tribal casinos and public establishments. Honeyford said instead of pull tabs and punch cards, businesses with gambling licenses could have electronic machines, which are similar, but not slot machines. He explained that the machines would go in businesses that already have gambling licenses and that there is a cap on the number of machines that could go in. A business that has revenue of between 400,000 and 500,000 per year would be limited to seven machines. Honeyford said the tribes are supposed to pay 2 percent of their revenues in a form of tax. Non-tribal gambling pays 20 percent on revenue. \"The tribes are concerned if this passes they will have competition,\" said Chandler. \"Right now they have none.\" Newhouse discussed I-872, which, if passed, would change the state primary election process so that the top two vote-getters would go onto the general election. The initiative would basically do away with the party system and become more of a popularity contest, said Newhouse. \"Parties would no longer nominate their candidate,\" said Newhouse. He added that candidates wouldn't state a party affiliation, but would rather state a party preference. \"If a candidate dies the party would no longer be able to replace the person by party,\" said Newhouse. The initiative would also essentially make it so that no other parties would be represented. Newhouse said that in 2000, more than 180,000 people in Washington state voted for someone other than the two major party candidates. Although some believe the initiative will have little impact on the elections, Newhouse said that in the past 20 years it would have affected 33 percent of the gubernatorial races. He said it would have changed the outcome of who would have been governor because in at least one Sing the governor wouldn't have made the general election ballot. Honeyford said the real question is do people want their voice restricted in the primary or in the general election? I-292, an initiative that would cease operations at Hanford, is also on the ballot, said Newhouse. Supporters of the initiative claim that more than a million gallons of waste have already leaked out, polluting the ground and the Columbia River. The initiative would require more extensive monitoring of ground water and would stop the addition of more waste until the waste that is on the site is completely cleaned up. Newhouse said that 90 percent of the waste from Hanford is going to other states and that the initiative puts inter-state relations in jeopardy. In the end the initiative will be played out in court, believes the three local legislators. \"It's a lawyer's dream,\" said Chandler, who added that the initiative would paralyze any work going on at the site and also close Pacific Northwest Lab, one of the leading labs in the nation. The one-cent increase in the state's portion of the sales tax, proposed in I-884, was the last initiative discussed at the meeting. The initiative is in response to I-728 and I-732, which were approved by voters, but the state couldn't afford to fund. Chandler said the money raised in the tax increase would be put into a dedicated fund for schools and administered by two separate citizens boards, one for pre-school and the other for schools serving older children. Chandler said what is dangerous about the initiative is that the money will be handled by people who are not elected officials. He added that the boards will have the rule-making authority. All the education general funds from the state would also be managed by the group. He said the state is estimating that 950 million over the next five years will be levied, but Chandler feels that number is high because the tax will discourage shoppers from buying within state, which will in turn hurt the local economy"}

The Masters of Mexican Music is a collaboration of accomplished artists. In its first national tour, Masters of Mexican Music immerses audiences in the rich musical tradition of Mexico. The performances include Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano, which will bring mariachi music to the stage; Jose Gutierrez y Los Hermanos Ochoa, who will perform musica jarocha style music; Mingo Saldivar y Los Cuatro Espadas, who will perform conjunto tejano music; and Marimba Chiapas, which will perform traditional marimba-style music. Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano is a group led by Natividad Cano, who was born into a family of mariachi musicians in Ahuisculco, Jalisco, Mexico in 1933. It wasn't until he moved to Los Angeles that he founded the group Los Camperos, which he has been directing for more than 40 years. In 1990, Cano was honored by the National Endowment for the Arts with the National Heritage Fellowship and he has had the honor of performing for two presidents at the White House. Jose Gutierrez y Los Hermanos Ochoa is a group led by Jose Gutierrez Ramun, who was born in Costa de la Palma, Mexico. He spent his childhood listening to his grandfather, father and uncles play music for enjoyment after a hard day's work. As a small child he took up the guitar and soon learned to play the jarana, a thin-bodied guitar that provides the rhythmic and harmonic base for jarocha music. Mingo Saldivar y Los Cuatro Espadas is a group from San Antonio, Texas. The leader of the group, Saldivar, was born in Marion, Texas in 1936 and learned to play the guitar by the age of 12. It wasn't too long after taking up the guitar that Saldivar learned to play the stand-up base and a year later he took up the accordion. In May 2002, the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center in San Antonio inducted Saldivar into the Conjunto Music Hall of Fame. Several weeks later he was named a National Endowment of the Arts National Heritage Fellow and later in 2002 he received his second Grammy nomination. Marimba Chiapas is a group led by Lorenzo Cruz, who was born in Tonal, Chiapas, Mexico in 1928. He was taught to play the marimba by Felipe Peoa. A marimba is constructed similarly to the xylophone and is often referred to as the \"Mexican piano.\" In 1973, Cruz moved to the United States, where he has continued to sustain the Mexican tradition of marimba music. Although the musical troupe that makes up the Masters of Mexican Music will perform Sunday, Nov. 7, at the Capitol Theatre, they will be in the Yakima Valley for three days performing at different locations. Saturday, Nov. 6, the troupe will perform at various outreach locations in the Valley, including a free performance at 2:30 p.m. at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Alderwood. Later that night Jose Gutierrez y Los Hermanos Ochoa will perform at Radio KDNA's 25th anniversary celebration at the Yakima Convention Center. Monday, Nov. 8, Marimba Chiapas will work with students at Granger High School at 9:30 a.m. At 1 p.m. the same day Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano will work with students at Grandview High School.

I am referring to the little poem by our local councilman, John Torch, in the latest editions of the Yakima Valley Business Times and the Alderwood Daily News. Mr. Torch, please start concerning yourself with city issues and quit bad mouthing agencies that don't agree with your sanctimonious views. Not all of Alderwood agrees with you. Maybe you should try working with the other agencies and stop with the \"If it's not my way, hit the hiway\" attitude. That attitude alone has cost the city in revenue dollars. No wonder people give our city a wide berth when it comes to relocating businesses and opportunities. And to Sue and Rob Rice, congratulations on your new business. It will definitely be a great asset to the Lower Valley. I wish you both nothing but success. /s/ Patty S. Denson, Alderwood Rockford great city manager I find it most interesting talking to citizens of Alderwood. The populace of Alderwood has so many opinions on so many subjects concerning our fine city. Recently, everywhere I go I hear people talking about the purchase of the Monson feedlot. Several people say the purchase was the right thing to do, but they should have bought the mill, too. Others say it was a waste to have bought it at all. Well, to me it doesn't matter. The smell of manure to me is much more refreshing than most of this perfume women wear. But if this community wants to move forward and not become stagnant as far as economic development goes, it was the right move. It seems as though being the city manager surely must be a thankless job. Tom Rockford has done more for this city as far as economic development goes than any manager in the last 20 years. He has grabbed the reins and led the way. I am not saying the others weren't good managers. The others were more appeasing type managers. It just seems to me that some groups of people in town want their projects done immediately. This city has fallen so far behind in the last decade that it will take time to get to where we should be. I personally think Rockford is a great manager and we will see some great movement forward with this city manager. But for you that don't, I am setting up a collection at the intersection of Sixth and Edison. Just throw your money in that manhole. I will collect the money and buy Rockford a magic wand! /s/ Don Padelford, Alderwood Image vs. character Recently, a contributor to this Forum column wrote in espousing the \"presidential charisma\" of candidate Kerry. He specifically referred to how well Mr. Kerry looked and acted in the third presidential debate. The writer seemed to be most impacted by the image Sen. Kerry portrayed. In this media saturated culture it seems that image is \"everything.\" Granted, looks are important but when it comes to picking a president for our nation we need to look beyond the pretty package. If we look back at two examples of previous presidents, we can point to glaringly stark contrasts. Remember Ronald Regan. What a gentleman. A man with rock-solid principles, a fantastic marriage and a man whose word was as good as his handshake. Even his enemies, such as Gorbachev, came to respect him. Contrast Reagan with Bill Clinton. Even before he won the presidency, a parade of \"bimbos\" gave witness to Clinton's marital indiscretions. Foreign leaders mocked him behind his back. As Commander in Chief, Clinton gutted the military. For example, he reduced active Air Force personnel from 650,000 to 240,000 people during his two terms. Many of the best officers voluntarily took early retirement rather than serve under a man they could not respect. And then to top it all, he lied in court and to the American people. His own state took away his license to practice law. So what does this have to do with the 2004 election? President Bush is a man of his word. He has principles and integrity. He stands for what he believes. Our military loves him as Commander in Chief. And he has a fantastic marriage. Then there's Sen. Kerry. Fresh from his four-month tour (others served one year) in Vietnam, he went before a Congressional hearing and confessed to war crimes while still a commissioned officer. Then he accused those he served with of crimes against civilians without one shred of evidence. He has voted against bills supporting new weapons and funding for the military. Yet, he claims that he has all the qualities to instill loyalty by our soldiers who daily lay their lives on the line to defend us from those who want to kill us and take our freedom. Give me a break! Finally, I want to remind my neighbors how ancient Israel's leader, David, was chosen. After all of Jessee's handsome sons had been paraded before Samuel, one little shepherd boy became one of the greatest kings in all history. When Samuel asked God why He chose David, God told Samuel that \"Men look on the outside (image) of a man, but the Lord looks on the heart (character) of a man.\" /s/ Rick Herndon, Alderwood Defending Kerry an attack on Vietnam veterans I was watching TV the other night when a representative from the Veterans Administration was asked whether Sen. John Kerry was telling the truth in 1971, or whether the \"Swift Vets for Truth\" were. This man said that John Kerry was telling the truth. I was shocked. My understanding is that even Kerry has said that he had no firm knowledge of atrocities to back up what he said back in 1971. He admits that he stretched the truth. So why would one of our representatives say that Kerry told the truth. I was in college in 1971 and I remember how hard it hit me when Kerry told those lies. I also remember that Congress was so upset by what Kerry had told them that they called in Telford Taylor from Columbia Law University in New York to investigate the atrocities being committed in Vietnam. You might recall that Taylor was the chief prosecutor during the War Crimes Trials in Nuremberg, Germany at the end of WWII. After Taylor's investigation he said that he found very few cases of true atrocities taking place in Vietnam. He did say that many times our soldiers had killed civilians, but in almost every case he investigated he found that it was not an atrocity at all. He said that these incidents were very sad and hard for soldiers to deal with, but they were not a crime according to the Geneva Convention. The civilians were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that the aim was not to kill the civilians just for the joy of it. In fact, most soldiers felt guilty for having killed innocent people during firefights. It was not their intent. In the end Taylor said the Rules of Engagement were impeccable. He said the Rules of Engagement were so impeccable that he found it difficult to believe that soldiers would follow them, as it would cost them their lives to do so. Taylor said that the way in which we fought the war caused many soldiers to lose their lives, in order that civilians would be spared theirs. And he said that he felt that was unacceptable during war. In the end he said the Vietnam War was the cleanest war that America had ever fought; that it had the fewest atrocities by any measure compared to other wars; and that he found a renewed sense of awe for those who were fighting the war, even though he was firmly against it. To my knowledge no one has disputed Taylor's assessment of the war with regards to war crimes having been committed by our troops, so why would one of our representatives say that Kerry was \"right\" back in 1971, referring to our fellow soldiers as war criminals? I think John Kerry threw gasoline on the fire back in 1971. He convinced people that Jane Fonda was right. And that caused the war protesters to harass the returning soldiers on college campuses at a higher level than what they had been doing before. I know, I was there. After Kerry spoke to Congress in 1971 it was very ugly for the veterans who were attending college and trying to further their education. In 1971 I remember watching (from afar) an anti-war rally on campus one day, and watched as the students cheered when it was announced how many returing Vietnam veterans had committed suicide after coming home. They truly wanted to see us dead. Their level of cruelty was more brutal than any acts by infantry soldiers that I had ever seen. The question remains: why doesn't John Kerry go on TV and debate these Swift Boat Veterans, and the POWs and the recipients of the Medal of Honor that have spoken out against him on TV ads? He could end this whole debate once and for all. He's a very good debater. He had the courage to debate George Bush, so why not do all Vietnam veterans a great favor and debate these men as well? They have proven to be honorable men, thus I would like him to step up to the plate and discuss this whole matter on national TV. That doesn't sound like much to me, especially if Kerry thinks he's right. I wish he would either defend himself against these veterans, or apologize for what he did. My view is that he needs to apologize for the lies he told, and the damage that those lies did to Vietnam veterans. And he especially needs to apologize to family members of those returning Vietnam veterans who committed suicide when they were unable to stand up to the attacks committed on them by their peers. It must be remembered that these veterans returned home physically fatigued, mentally fatigued and spiritually fatigued. They required nurturing, not the attacks hurled at them. But still today people come to the defense of John Kerry and encourage others to continue to attack our veterans. For any defense of John Kerry is an attack on those who honorably served in Vietnam, and who say that they are proud of their service in Vietnam, and who also say that they would serve again if asked. /s/ Greg Schlieve, Vietnam veteran, Grandview"}

The three Focus High School students have been instrumental in the development of Red Ribbon Week activities in the Mabton School District this year, designed to discourage drug use. The girls know what it is like to skip school, to get high and to drop out of school. In many ways it is what led them to Focus High School, an alternative school, which gave them a second chance at education. What they hope to do this year is convey a message, especially to the younger kids in the Mabton School District, that they don't need to do drugs. Appling said she knows of elementary school aged children who talk about doing drugs. \"That's the biggest problem in our community,\" Beltran added. The girls each had a chance to share their stories with elementary aged students Thursday morning. Skits were also performed. \"I think if they hear from us, being teenagers, it will make a difference,\" said Beltran. \"I know how little kids are. Little kids look up to us. We see ourselves and I don't want them to end up like me.\" \"We're showing them that getting high is not cool and we're showing them they don't have to do drugs,\" said Appling. The three girls, who are now back on the educational track, hope to prevent those younger than them from ending up in their situations. They hope that Red Ribbon Week activities will help the younger kids make good decisions in their lives. Beltran said that she can't go back to the regular high school. A senior at Focus, she dropped out of Mabton High and made a name for herself in the community, one that hasn't been easy to shake. \"People still look at me and think druggie and other things,\" said the former Miss Mabton. \"It's not like you can go back,\" she added. Learning from their teacher Stephen Busby, that \"opportunity dies when it is neglected,\" they took this opportunity to give other kids in the community a chance to start off right and not get involved with drugs and alcohol. The three girls came up with a list of ideas to promote Red Ribbon Week in Mabton. Students are dressing up, pledging to be drug free by signing bricks, which are making up a wall at the high school, and the younger students are participating in coloring, essay and poster contests. This morning multi-millionaire Rich Post will be speaking to the elementary aged students. According to Beltran, Post formerly sold drugs, was sent to jail twice but has changed his life. \"He's making his life doing something other than selling drugs,\" she added. This week the girls have each had a favorite project they have undertaken. Although it has been chilly, they all agreed that decorating the town with red ribbons has been fun. Appling has enjoyed gathering pledges to be drug free from high school students and handing out the red ribbons, as has Beltran. For Lupercio, the best part of the project was presenting ideas for activities to the youths at Artz-Fox Elementary School. \"They were all pumped,\" she said. Since their first visit to the school, Beltran said, younger kids have approached them on the streets, asking the girls to pick their classroom to be the winners of an ice cream party. \"I think it's important to get the message out,\" said Lupercio of Red Ribbon Week. \"A lot of the younger kids don't realize what they are doing when they get involved in drugs. It's been difficult, but fun"}

The new unit will add two classrooms to the campus at the Mabton Jr.-Sr. High School building, giving math teachers Ron Fleming and John Durham regular classrooms, said Keith Morris, high school principal. He said both teachers are currently using non-classroom facilities within the district. Fleming's makeshift classroom is located within a room near the district bus garage and Durham is now utilizing the district board room as a classroom, Morris explained. Morris said the addition of staff and additional enrollment led to the need for extra classroom space. He said the new portable classroom will be used for junior high and high school math class instruction. The addition of the two classrooms will cost the district an estimated 100,000, said Mabton Superintendent Sandra Pasiero-Davis. She said the cost also includes such things as setting the unit upon a new foundation, and electrical and water needs. The unit will be situated at the south end of the high school parking lot and should be ready for use 10 weeks after the unit is ordered, Pasiero-Davis said. In other action taken at its Oct. 25 meeting, the board approved a safe school/healthy students agreement with Educational Services District 105.

He is afraid to let go of the ideas and beliefs he picked up in his youth lest his life be seen as empty and wasted.\" Be your own person and choose wisely. /s/ Eric Amador, Seattle, Alderwood High School class of 1995 Re-elect Bush When people look back at the Bush Administration in years to come, they will see that the No Child Left Behind Act was one of the most significant pieces of legislation signed into law in decades. Why? Because it puts educational standards into place for all students. This is especially important for low income and minority students, too many of whom have fallen through the cracks in our public education system over the years. Results are already showing up in our local school districts, as well as in other districts that have struggled across the country. As with so many other issues, President Bush is a noteworthy exception to the average politician. When he encounters a problem, his response is not to complain or blame someone else for the problem. His response is to try to solve the problem. We don't often have a president with the vision to lead in this fashion. But we can certainly keep this one for four more years. Please join me in voting to re-elect George W. Bush. /s/ Sandra Linde, Outlook Privatization at what cost? The proposal to privatize Alderwood's public works department raises some important issues. Having lived in an urban center on the west side of the state for several years, I had the opportunity to observe the performances of a number of agencies that chose to employ privatized service providers. Privatization was generally initiated by new management, often not long term residents of the locale, interested in trimming the budget. The tactic was to persuade the general public that eliminating such expensive items as decent living wages, cost of living allowances and health benefit packages would lower the cost of city and county services and provide a financial boost for the local economy. However, a major consideration was ignored: when a public works crew, like the one in Alderwood, dedicates a consistent work effort, shows concern for the needs of the public, and invests time and money in the community voluntarily, as residents, outside of the work schedule. The result is that not only do the new \"privatized\" employees fail to respond in a timely fashion to citizens' needs, but they are not invested in the community. So the quality of performance is heavily diminished. I would hope that the people of Alderwood are willing to carefully scrutinize the proposal to privatize the public works department. It would be, in my opinion, a major error in judgment. /s/ Sonja McDaniel, Alderwood The Little Council of S side (Related to The Little Red Hen) One day as the little Council of Alderwood was struggling, having issues with clean air, clean water and quality of life; \"This should be resolved,\" they said. \"Who will help us with this problem?\" \"Not I,\" said Yakima County. \"Not I,\" said Yakima Clean Air Authority. \"Not I,\" said New Vision. \"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they did. Soon, the need to measure and define the problem came. \"The problem is ripe,\" said the Council of Alderwood. \"Who will help us measure and define?\" \"Not I,\" said the Washington Dept. of Ecology. \"Not I,\" said the Washington Dept. of Agriculture. \"Not I,\" said the Washington Dairy Federation. \"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they did. When the issues were defined and partners were needed to help resolve, the Council of Alderwood said, \"Who will partner with us in this endeavor?\" \"Not I,\" said the Alderwood Port District. \"Not I,\" said the Alderwood Inc. board. \"Not I,\" said the Alderwood Chamber of Commerce. \"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they did. When the issue became political, the Council of Alderwood said, \"Who will help resolve these politics?\" \"Not I,\" said Dan Newhouse. \"Not I,\" said Bruce Chandler. \"Not I,\" said Jesse Palacios. \"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they tried. They addressed the issue to the press and asked for fair and balanced reporting. Then asked, \"Who will report the information fair and balanced?\" \"Not I,\" said the Dark Side News. \"Not I,\" said the Yakima Herald. \"Not I,\" said the Tri-Cities Herald. \"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they tried. They negotiated the deal, paid the costs, became their own partners and made it a win-win. \"Who will take the credit and benefit from this?\" \"Oh! I will,\" said the Port. \"Oh! I will,\" said the County. \"Oh! I will,\" said the State. \"No, no,\" said the Council of Alderwood. \"We will do that.\" AND THEY DID. /s/ John Torch, Alderwood Why buy a car? Recently, I went into a local automobile dealership in an attempt to trade-in my car. I didn't get a new car, but did get confused and somewhat shocked with the whole \"trading in your car\" business. I understand that a dealership needs to make money in order to have a viable business, but how much is too much? And at whose expense? Like many of your readers, I know the difference between the retail values and and the trade-in values. But it wasn't until my last negotiating attempts that I really grasped what it meant. Let's assume that a trade-in value for a car is 2,500 less than the retail value. Automobile dealerships will not typically pay more than the trade-in value of a car, which means they automatically make a 2,500 profit. Furthermore, the cars at dealerships are typically overpriced by an average of 4,000 (from what I have been told by friends in the car business). This means that if you trade in your car at the trade-in value rate and buy a car at the retail value, the dealership would make 6,500 in one deal. Imagine that! Now...imagine this happening to about 50 deals a month. That totals 325,000 in profits in one month. Automobile dealerships are out to take advantage of consumers. It's not like if consumers can just say to heck with it. The reality is, consumers need transportation to survive. The price that dealerships blindly force consumers to pay, however, is an outrage. Consumers, including myself, need to be thoroughly educated on the type of deals they are getting into. After all, it's not a well kept secret that cars are a bad investment. If you don't really need a new car, why reinvest into yet another money shortfall. /s/ Ana Gonzales, Grandview"}

Knowing that a little work needed to be done on the furnace, my husband and I finally got around to calling the gas company to come turn on the gas this week. We called a repairman to come and look at our furnace and boy am I glad we did. My husband has been fighting the furnace since he bought the house nearly two years ago. Several repairmen have entered our lives, and it seems that running the furnace is now a more difficult task. They had it \"fixed\" on several occasions, but alas it was not. Besides having difficulty lighting the pilot light, the heater wouldn't stop blowing air last year. Well, we found a new repairman and he broke the bad news yesterday morning that our furnace has bit the dust. In fact, it probably should have been put out of its misery a few seasons ago. In the meantime, I am finding every blanket in my house to battle the dipping cold temperatures. I pray for cloudy nights so the cloud cover keeps the temperatures above freezing at night. The suggestion has been made that we get a space heater, but I'm afraid of burning the house down with one of those things. For any CSI watchers out there, my fears were confirmed with the last episode I watched when the crime scene investigators determined that the fire that put a man in jail was due to a space heater that over-loaded a breaker. We have a heating blanket, which is a wonderful thing. It keeps us cozy warm. Maybe a little too warm. I can only handle having my feet covered by the blanket. To stay warm, I have gone to the old fashioned way of keeping warm. I wear layers and layers of clothes. Sweats, sweatshirts, long underwear, thermal socks, whatever I can find. I cover the whole works with a blanket and call it good. My only complaint is my nose gets cold. Although it is chilly in the house, at least we have a solid roof over our heads, especially with the rains we have experienced lately. It really makes me think of those less fortunate and also of a project a group of college students have held in Alderwood the past three or four years. The 24-hour freeze event held by Washington State University Kappa Delta Chi sorority and Omega Delta Phi fraternity members collects food, clothing and blankets for local families. I haven't heard if the group plans on returning to the Lower Valley this fall for another \"freeze\" event, but I hope they do. I have heard of families in the Alderwood area who have resorted to using their kitchen oven to heat their homes. Heck, when I'm just tooling around the house, I have candles lit, which helps raise the house temperature. Watch for the freeze event or look for other groups that are gathering items for those less fortunate. Let's show the warmth in our hearts and make it a cozy time of year for everyone. .

BRUNELL Selling change is always difficult, but when it involves public schools and our kids' education, it is daunting at best. Dr. Rod Paige is President Bush's Secretary of Education and the chief architect of \"No Child Left Behind.\" Surprisingly, he is the first superintendent of schools to hold that post. Paige's father was a public school principal, his mother a public school librarian. Born in 1933 in segregated Monticello, Mississippi, Paige earned a Bachelor's degree from Jackson State University and a Master's and Doctoral degree from Indiana University. Prior to joining the Bush Cabinet, he was superintendent of schools in Houston. Dr. Paige has a disarming style. For example, while in Seattle recently, he conducted a town hall meeting where teachers and activists confronted him over their frustrations with Washington's school reforms, the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL), and \"No Child Left Behind.\" He listened carefully and thoughtfully responded. Most importantly, while he may have disagreed with the speaker, he respected their right to disagree. At the end of the evening, some of his antagonists continued to disagree with him and the school reforms he supports, but he commanded the respect due to a top federal education official. Dr. Paige told the audience that tests are necessary to evaluate a student's progress. For example, without a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, there is no way to know if a person has high blood pressure and to monitor it to ensure that treatment is working. The same goes for education-you need tools and measurements to make informed decisions. Paige also believes test scores are a measure of where students have problems, and he rejects the notion of averaging school and district test scores as an indicator of progress. \"No Child Left Behind\" is not about averaging the scores of high performers and low achievers. It is about ensuring that kids don't fall through the cracks, passed from grade to grade unable to master the skills they'll need to succeed in the real world. For example, studies show that if a student cannot read proficiently after the third grade, their problems in school only compound. He encourages parents to read to their children and have their children read to them. \"No Child Left Behind\" also sets aside federal funds for tutoring students from low income and disadvantaged families. Dr. Paige reminded his audience that President Bush has increased education funding by nearly 60 percent since the Clinton Administration left office. He also was quick to point out that funding for K-12 is the state's responsibility and the federal government supplements, not supplants, that support. Finally, Paige unabashedly supports school choice and charter schools-highly unpopular with the teachers' union. He believes all students and parents should have choices, not just the families who can afford to send their children to private schools. Being on the front line, battling for change is a tough job even with less volatile issues, but Dr. Paige has handled his job well. Americans should be grateful there are dedicated educators like Paige because their persistence will keep our country competitive and full of opportunity. Like Gov. Locke, Education Secretary Rod Paige is convinced that education breaks down racial, cultural and poverty barriers. It is the great equalizer in our culture. Don C. Brunell is President of the Association of Washington Business"}

To the shock of the unbeaten and Central Washington 'B' League leading Moses Lake Christian club (8-0), Alderwood Christian senior Jordan Haak headed in a corner kick from his cousin, junior Matt Haak, for a goal to give the underdog Knights an early 1-0 lead. \"You start to think some pretty exciting things when you're ahead of Moses Lake just five minutes into the game,\" said Russ Smies, who's in his first year of coaching the Knights but is still looking for his first conference victory. The early shock Moses Lake Christian experienced quickly wore off, though. \"They went on a tear against us,\" said Smies. Three minutes after the Haak cousins combined their efforts to put Alderwood Christian ahead, the home team struck with a goal off the foot of Brendon McCornack. Moses Lake Christian then rattled off four more goals in the next 15 minutes to forge a 5-1 advantage. McCornack added a second goal in that four-goal run, with Jesse Bassett providing the other three. Another goal just before intermission from Phillip Friehe put Moses Lake up 6-1 at the half. \"They were ripping right through the middle,\" Smies said of the well oiled machine his Knights went up against yesterday. \"They pass the ball extremely well, they make precision cuts...they're very intense. \"It's obvious Moses Lake puts a lot of work into it. They're an amazing team. That's why they're leading the league,\" Smies added. The second half was a slightly different story. Moses Lake Christian could only find the net one more time, mostly to the stepped up play displayed by the visiting Knights. \"They subbed a bit towards the end of the game,\" said Smies, \"But we definitely turned it up in the second half.\" Smies credits the Haak cousins for most of the increased intensity after intermission. \"The two of them were working very well together in the second half,\" he said. \"They had some very nice give-and-gos,\" he added. The sparkling teamwork paid off for the Knights in the 15th minute of the second period. The older Haak swept in a pass from senior Micah Koopmans, sped down the field while juking a couple of defenders and cleanly booted in a goal to cut Moses Lake's lead to 6-2. Moses Lake's John Townsend countered the score in the 68th minute of the game with a goal of his own to account for the final 7-2 score. Alderwood Christian actually had a couple of golden opportunities to cut into Moses Lake's lead even more. Unfortunately for the visitors, two wide open shots taken by the younger Haak careened off the top bar of the Moses Lake goalpost. \"After awhile, you kind of scratch your head and wonder when the shots are going to start going in the net for you,\" Smies said. \"It gets to be frustrating after awhile.\" All in all Tuesday afternoon, Moses Lake Christian only outshot the Knights by a 13 to 9 margin. Alderwood goalkeeper John Bosma was credited with six saves. The Knights (0-8, 5-10), who have already been eliminated from the postseason, close out the season this coming Friday at home against Trout Lake"}

The Mabton Junior/Senior High School drill team is at every home football game during the season, marching out on the field to entertain the crowd with their halftime performances. The drill team is made of 11 hard working girls who find time to practice every day, be if for an hour and half before school or for two hours in the evening. Drill Team Advisor Connie Beeman said her team practices whenever they can find time and wherever there is room. She explained that during the busy winter sports season, the team will typically practice in the school library. This marks the third year Mabton has had a drill team in nearly a decade. Beeman said three years ago a group of girls created a list of names of people who would be interested in being part of a drill team and from there the program blossomed. Beeman said she has been the drill team advisor for the past two years. Recently there has been so much interest in joining the team that members are selected through tryouts. Beeman said this year 48 girls tried out for the team. According to Beeman, tryouts take place over a two-week period. She said those who are interested in being on the team are each taught a basic turn, a basic leap and a short routine. Then on tryout night, the girls come out three at a time and show the judges what they have learned. Once the girls make it through the rigorous two-week tryout period, their work is just beginning. Beeman said this year the team attended a camp in Portland, Ore. hosted by the Thunderbird Dance Company. She said the Mabton team attended the more advanced camp and came away with 11 routines and several trophies. The routines the girls learned at camp are slowly finding their way onto the field at Mabton High School. When they are not using a routine they learned at camp, Beeman said the team works together to choreograph their own moves. She said when choreographing the team will split up into groups led by one of the four team captains, then each group will make up eight counts of a routine. The multiple eight counts are then linked together to form a new routine. Beeman said her team is branching out this year when it comes to the types of routines they are taking on. She explained that besides doing routines to hip-hop music, the team is doing more themed routines. She said they have a Western routine they do, as well as a 1970s routine and a routine involving boy bands. \"We want to touch all sorts of groups,\" Beeman said. She added that her team is comprised of hard working girls, noting that she recently asked the girls if they wanted to take a short break between football and basketball season and the answer she got back was a resounding no. Instead, the drill team is practicing three days a week and Saturdays for four hours to prepare for the upcoming basketball season. An interesting aspect of the drill team is that its members are composed of not only high school students, but also several junior high school students. Erica Calixto, an eighth grader, said she decided last year that she wanted to try out for the drill team. \"I like to dance,\" Calixto said. She said she also likes the feeling of getting out in the middle of the football field or the center of a crowded gym and dancing. Beeman said she is hoping that the more her team performs and the more competitions and camps they are able to attend, the more people will be interested in joining the drill team"}

Nethercutt's husband, Congressmen George Nethercutt, is seeking Patty Murray's position in the U.S. Senate. Mrs. Nethercutt, said her husband is standing on his voting record that has been positive for Washington state, which includes supporting farmers and supporting the dams when the push was to remove them. \"He's also in favor of an energy policy,\" said Mrs. Nethercutt. \"Our current senator has voted against a common sense energy policy.\" She said that her husband has been able to reach across party lines and work with both Republicans and Democrats alike to accomplish things that are good for the country. \"You can't get everything you want, but if you can get 75 or 80 percent, then that's good,\" said Nethercutt. She said her husband's opponent has repeatedly voted to filibuster, which keeps debate on a topic from ending so that even a preliminary vote can't get to the Senate floor. The judges nominated by President Bush is one of the issues that hasn't been voted on. \"Approve or disapprove, but at least vote on it,\" she said. \"George has a great voting record. He's got a great record on the issues,\" she said. Unfortunately, she added, a lot of bills come out of the House and are \"...buried in the graveyard of the Senate.\" Besides stem cell research, Nethercutt said her husband is in favor of drilling in the Arctic. She said that when super-imposed over the continental United States, Alaska covers about 1/3rd of the country. She explained that when they talk about drilling they are only talking about touching 2,000 acres of 19 million acres of pristine wilderness. \"Until we have energy independence we are going to be held hostage at the fuel pumps,\" said Nethercutt. The South Carolina native added that her husband supported the dams in Washington state when there was a push to remove them. George Nethercutt has also been instrumental in working with the Bush administration to develop a research facility at Washington State University that would be able to test for Mad Cow Disease, she said. \"The next closest facility is in Iowa,\" said Mrs. Nethercutt. She added that her husband is also in favor of capping the amount that can be paid out for pain and suffering in lawsuits against doctors in the state. She said that Washington is losing talented physicians and it is not only the rural communities that are feeling the brunt of the shortage. At a rally in Spokane last week, she said a woman who is due to have a baby in February spoke about her needs of a obstetrician. She shared that this is her third child and third obstetrician, the others have left the state. Nethercutt said that she is hoping her doctor will still be practicing when her baby is due. \"Doctors are worried about being sued,\" said Nethercutt. \"They will run more tests than their heart or mind tells them they should, and that drives up costs.\" One of the most frustrating aspects of the election is the incumbent senator's reluctance to debate the issues. She said her husband invited Patty Murray to debate in each of the counties in the state. Murray agreed to two debates, said Mrs. Nethercutt. Both were also invited to the Downtown Seattle Rotary Club for a debate, but only Nethercutt attended, because Murray said her schedule was too busy, said Mrs. Nethercutt. She added that when Nethercutt went up against Speaker of the House Tom Folley, there were nine debates. Minority Leader Tom Daschle participated in seven debates. \"There must be a reason she doesn't want to talk about her voting record,\" said Mrs. Nethercutt"}

But despite postseason aspirations having to wait another season, Alderwood Coach Mark Marro is hoping his team can muster up some pride as the Grizzlies will try to finish with a winning season. Alderwood (2-3, 4-4) will finish Mid-Valley League play this Friday at Selah. The Grizzlies will then end the regular season at home the following week against the fifth seed out of the Central Washington Athletic Conference. The shutout loss to the Bulldogs has more of a story than the final score might indicate. \"We played with a lot of young guys,\" said Marro. \"They (Ellensburg) got a gift.\" Due to injuries and other reasons, Marro had to go into Ellensburg with several of his younger players, who aren't used to performing at this level. \"Overall, I thought we played phenomenal,\" said Marro. \"We were thin, but we played hard.\" Grizzly fans might be inspired by the fact that Ellensburg led the game just 7-0 with about four minutes to go. One performance that stood out for Alderwood on Friday was the play of B.J. Miller, who played safety with a cast on his hand. Marro said the Grizzly offense was able to put together several offensive threats throughout the game, driving down inside Ellensburg's 20-yard line on a couple of occasions, but could never finish off a drive. \"We had our shots at it,\" said Marro. The offense was a bit troubled with the absence of one of its stars, Greg Gilleland. Gilleland had to miss the game after an altercation during Homecoming with Wapato. The duties in the backfield were mainly left to Joe Schwartz. \"Schwartz ran the ball hard, but it is hard when you are by yourself,\" said Marro. Marro said his defense did well on Friday. He said his defensive line was pounding Ellensburg. \"The linebackers did a really good job,\" said Marro. Marro is looking forward to this Friday's game at Selah. The Vikings have a new addition to their coaching staff this season in former Greyhound head coach Wayne Purdom, who is heading up the defense. \"Selah is a lot like us,\" said Marro. \"They throw the ball minimally and they just run the ball at you.\" Marro said the Grizzlies should be at full force next week with everyone in the line-up. \"Now it is about pride,\" said Marro"}

On the opening drive of the game, which started from their own 20, the Vikes marched the ball down to Highland's 42-yard line, from where Mabton QB Ryan Harris hooked up with Pablo Sanchez on a touchdown throw. \"That was big,\" said Search. \"It was an excellent start.\" Highland countered, though, on the ensuing drive. Jacob Buchanan, who led all rushers in the game with 163 yards, capped off the Scotties' opening drive with a 21-yard scamper into the end zone. The PAT that followed squared the contest at 7-all. The Scotties scored again in the opening quarter, when Highland's punt return squad burst through Mabton's line and blocked the kick. Highland recovered the loose pigskin in the end zone for its second TD of the night. Highland took a 20-7 lead in the second quarter when one of its defenders picked off a pass from Harris and raced 48 yards to pay dirt. The only other score Highland could muster against the Vikings was a one-yard TD run by Buchanan, that coming in the third quarter. Despite Buchanan, who is the Valley's 1A rushing leader this season, gaining 163 yards on the ground on 29 carries, Search felt his club did an admirable job against the scatback type runner. \"Our defensive line actually did a pretty good job Friday,\" Search said. \"There were seven times we tackled Buchanan in the back field.\" Search also pointed out that his defensive unit limited Highland's quarterback to just 27 aerial yards, on 6-of-10 passing. Offensively, Mabton moved the ball at a better clip than did the Scotties. The Vikings gained 207 offensive yards, compared to Highland's 197 total yards. Most of the Mabton yardage came on the ground. Alex Zavala was the Vikes' leading rusher, picking his way through the Highland defenders for 67 yards on 15 totes. Ray Elizondo added a 33-yard rushing performance for the Vikes on eight carries, and Sanchez tallied 26 yards on nine touches. Through the air, Harris threw for 75 yards on 3-of-14 passing. Search gives much of the credit for Mabton's offensive prowess to his offensive line. \"They played pretty well,\" he said of his linemen. The bottom line, though, was turnovers. Any time Mabton got something started, the Scotties somehow came away with a takeaway. In looking ahead to this coming Friday's game at home against Soap Lake, Search said his team will have to play assignment defense to shut down the visitors. \"Soap Lake is a lot like Manson,\" he said. \"They play a Wing-T offense, where there's lots of misdirection and they pull their guards a lot.\" Search said a victory over Soap Lake this coming Friday, coupled with a win at Entiat the following Friday, will give his Vikes (4-2, 5-3) the No. 2 seed into the South/Central 'B' League playoffs"}

Washington state Gov. Gary Locke announced earlier this month the reappointment of Matson to the state's Community Economic Revitalization Board (CERB). \"The legislature funds the board in varying amounts,\" said Matson. The point of the economic revitalization board is to help economically distressed areas across the state. Matson said the economic revitalization board is funded to the tune of 5 to 10 million every biennium. The board lends economic support to such entities as port districts and counties looking for help with funding projects. Matson has served two previous terms on the board. His current term will expire Sept. 2, 2007. The board currently has 19 people from different fields around the state serving, with one vacancy. Matson is also the current vice chair of the group. Toppenish resident Judy Boekholder serves as board chair. Miland Walling of Bickleton is a small business representative on the group. Rep. Dan Newhouse of Alderwood is one of the state officials serving on the agency board. Matson first became involved with the CERB board while attending some meetings representing the Port of Alderwood. Matson said CERB had helped fund some projects for the local port district. \"I was aware of the value of it,\" said Matson. \"I pretty much knew it was a good program before I got on board.\" Matson said a position opened on CERB to represent the port districts and he grabbed the opportunity. Matson opted to seek another term on the board because he enjoys and believes in what the group is doing. \"I enjoy working with the projects and see what is going on,\" said Matson. Matson said it is rewarding to see how the CERB program has helped communities prosper. The board members meet six times a year with most of the gatherings occurring at Sea-Tac. Matson said between three and four projects are funded at each meeting. Over the years, CERB has helped fund many successful economic development projects. But some of the most successful projects Matson has been involved with came in 1998. Matson said Gov. Gary Locke recognized the need to improve transportation infrastructure to help attract businesses. Matson said many cities across the state took advantage of the opportunity provided by the state to make improvements. The Port of Alderwood and the City of Prosser received money to make improvements to Midvale Road and Wine Country Road, respectively. CERB has also helped the Port of Alderwood with funding for improvements to its wastewater treatment plant. The CERB program is going really well right now, said Matson. \"We have a pretty good funding base for the next couple of years,\" said Matson. Matson said locally there are no projects he knows of that will come before CERB in the near future. But, he added, \"It would surprise me if we didn't have any come up.\" One part Matson enjoys is the diversity of the group. Matson said the group is well represented by Eastern Washington people. However, Matson said the west vs. east side of the mountain politics never comes into play. \"It is a pretty good group of people,\" said Matson. \"It is a good program"}

Thursday afternoon, Alderwood Chamber of Commerce Director of Promotions and Tourism Kathy Corliss talked to members of the Granger Chamber of Commerce about the 2005 event and the work that is already going into it. Corliss said Spring Fling is an event that has brought together chambers of commerce from Wapato to Benton City. She explained that the Yakima Valley chambers are working together to organize a 10-day festival that will attract those who are visiting the area for Spring Barrel tasting to stay and enjoy what the Valley has to offer. Corliss said since the inception of Spring Barrel tasting, the event has grown to such a magnitude that area wineries are beginning to expand, what was once a one weekend event, into a two weekend affair. She said wineries found that as Spring Barrel tasting grew they weren't able to spend the one-on-one time with their customers. Now, wineries are beginning to invite their VIP customers to attend a pre-barrel tasting event the weekend before. And it's that expansion of Spring Barrel tasting that the local chambers are trying to build on. Corliss explained that local businessman Tom Denlea, who recently opened the Best Western Grapevine Inn in Alderwood, brought the idea of a Valley-wide festival to the forefront after observing the Tulip Festival that takes place every year in the Skagit Valley. Corliss said Denlea noted that the communities in that area worked together to fill the 13 days of the Tulip Festival with a variety of activities. \"So when people are in town for the Tulip Festival, they have something to do that isn't necessary tulip [related],\" Corliss said. She added that as a result of the combined efforts the festival brings 16 million in tourism revenue into the Skagit Valley. She said the Spring Fling festival can serve as a way for the communities in the Yakima Valley to take advantage of the many visitors who come into the area for Spring Barrel tasting. Corliss admitted that when planning for the festival first started, the different communities involved were a little territorial. However, as time has gone by the communities have realized that working together is what is important when it comes to making the festival a success. \"It has been a great process,\" Corliss said. At this point, Corliss said the group of chambers involved in coordinating the Spring Fling festival are working on preparing the calendar of events. She encouraged any organization interested in putting together an event to come forward. \"We're excited about it,\" she said, noting that the event is already starting to see growth. Other business that took place during the Granger Chamber of Commerce meeting yesterday included the presentation of a check to the Granger Aquatics Committee. Chamber President Mary Kresse presented a check for 500 to the committee, challenging 10 other people to donate 100 each, which two members did. To date, the Granger Aquatics Committee has raised 5,860 toward a new pool facility for the community. To help raise additional funds, the committee is hosting a yard sale at the Lions Club building at 109 E. A St. in Granger, Saturday, Oct. 23, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Donations for the yard sale are being accepted at the site from noon to 5 p.m. today (Friday"}

Good news, right? Wrong! For one thing, those frown and laugh lines disappeared from only one side of my face. And the second and biggest reason this wasn't some blessing from the Youth Goddess is that the \"eraser\" was Bell's Palsy. That name was familiar to me, but I didn't know it was a virus that hops onto the 7th cranial nerve and stomps the life out of the facial muscles that nerve controls. But I know it now. And have found out a lot of other people know it, too. Everyone who has seen my new paralyzed look has either had Bell's Palsy or knows someone who has had it. It is no respecter of age-12-year-olds are no more exempt than 40s, 50s or people like me who recently smiled through a wonderful 70th birthday party my kids threw for me. Bell's Palsy leaves us all with saggy, droopy, lopsided faces that can smile on only one side. Then there's that one, wide-open, glaring eye that not only can't shut, but can't even blink. It's not a pretty sight. And, it easily strikes terror into children, as I found out when I visited an ophthalmologist to learn how to protect my eyesight during this \"new experience.\" This kid in the office-about nine years old, couldn't take his horrified gaze off my taped-shut eye and hound dog look. Evidentally he'd been raised to be polite because he really tried not to look. Rather than ignore his obvious curiosity or bore him with medical details, I just grinned a gargoyle smile at him and said, \"I'm ready for Halloween.\" It gave him a laugh. Better than screaming. Bell's Palsy has thrown a crimp in my plans for getting acquainted in Alderwood. I moved here in mid-September, and wanted to drop in on a Kosmos meeting for people over 50. Somehow this isn't the face I wanted to introduce to a group I've heard good things about. Even if I can now do a pretty good imitation of one-eyed Popeye the Sailor Man, they probably aren't ready for me. Driving is too difficult, anyway. A good looking, over-50 guy I talked to this week took a bolder approach than I'm managing to do. He said he's had this virus twice, once when he was 25 and again about seven years ago. He said he bought an eyepatch at Bi-Mart, slapped it on and continued to play a great game of darts. I told him he must have looked very debonair. \"...and gallant,\" he added, with a grin (on both sides of his face). It's inspiring to see and hear about people who have recovered in weeks or months, less hopeful to hear \"years\" or \"never.\" In a recent article, I read that Theresa Heinz Kerry, 62-year-old wife of presidential hopeful John Kerry, was asked about her rumored Botox injections. She not only admitted to them, but said it was almost time for another treatment. Looking at her smooth forehead and baby-butt-cheeks, I'd say she was good for one more campaign trail. If I understood my ophthalmologist correctly, Botox does the same thing Bell's Palsy does, but on a mini-scale. So, unlike Mrs. Kerry who is looking forward to her next smooth 'em out injections, I am eagerly awaiting my 7th cranial nerve's rejuvenation and the return of all my frown and laugh lines. Bring on the wrinkles. I want them. I need them. Hey-I earned 'em! Besides, I can kiss better when both sides of my mouth are working. .

The goal would ultimately help the Lady 'Hounds defeat the Wildcats, and get them one step closer to postseason play. The Grandview girls soccer team won over the Wildcats 2-0. The game marked senior night for the Lady 'Hounds and their last game of the regular season under the hot lights of the football stadium. Grandview Coach Anne Holden said the victory was nice for the team's seniors, adding that both goals were scored by seniors. Jessica Rodriguez scored the first goal of the game in the first 10 seconds against the Wildcats, said Holden. She scored unassisted. Grandview's second goal was scored by senior Akane Tomizawa in the 22nd minute of the match-up. She scored off of an assist from Rodriquez. Overall, Grandview had 14 attempts on goal for the night, compared to one attempt by the Toppenish team. Holden said her team played well against the Wildcats, noting that they have really stepped up their game in recent match-ups. She said her team has also been very supportive of each other, noting that even with several position changes in recent games team members are continuing to push forward and look for the win. \"They've all contributed in their own way,\" Holden said of her team members. Holden said she thinks one big difference has been the recent move of Rodriguez from goalkeeper to midfielder. She said bringing her up front has given the team a new confidence. \"It's changed the whole approach,\" Holden said. The Grandview team (3-7, 4-9) has two games left in regular season play. Holden explained that if the team can win against Othello next week, they will be tied for the fourth seed to Districts. The tie will mean the two teams will have to face off to determine who will go into the postseason. Holden said the last few wins her team has pulled off has put the Lady 'Hounds in the driver's seat when it comes to the postseason.

{"Id":"1101162541092","Title":"Plan in place to monitor spread of BSE in United States","Author":"John Panni","Time":"10/21/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"PROSSER - Dr. Rory Meyer of the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, a division of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), was the featured speaker at the Washington State University Research Center in Prosser Thursday afternoon. Meyer spoke about a testing program USDA has in place to test cattle for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), better known as \"Mad Cow\" disease. BSE had been a problem in England for more than a decade, where the cattle supply was nearly annihilated. The BSE problem came to North America first hitting the United States in December 2001 when a cow in nearby Alderwood was diagnosed with the disease. BSE is a neurological disease in cattle. The disease is mainly passed in cattle by feed. However, the disease can also be passed genetically, said Meyer. Until bans were put into place on the type of feed that could be used, cattle were fed meat and bone meal to help provide the animals with needed protein and calcium. Meyer said the USDA and other agencies spent six to seven weeks investigating the first BSE case to ever hit the United States. Meyer said that the BSE cow in Alderwood, which was exported from Canada, and the cow with BSE found in Alberta, Canada, at one time were kept within 50 to 100 miles of each other. Meyer, though, said the risk is extremely low for BSE to become a problem in the U.S. like it was in England. He cited a 2001 study done by Harvard University that said with all the safety measures the United States has in place to prevent BSE, the risk for the disease to spread like it did in England is extremely low. \"Even if we were to get it, with all the bans we have in place it should phase out,\" said Meyer. But to help ensure consumer confidence and to find out where the BSE situation stands in the United States, USDA has begun a BSE testing program, said Meyer. The program will be overseen by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) division within USDA. Meyer said the testing program will be across the country, lasting between 12 and 18 months. The program began this past June, Meyer said, and will be a one-time effort by USDA. The program is meant to see if BSE is present in the cattle industry and if so at what levels. Under the program, USDA will assist cattle farmers with any cost of participating in the program. USDA officials will only be testing cattle in the high-risk population, meaning non-ambulatory cattle, cattle exhibiting signs of a central nervous disorder, cattle exhibiting signs associated with BSE and dead cattle. \"If we are going to find them (cattle with BSE), we are going to find them in that high-risk category,\" said Meyer. Meyer said the program will be targeting cattle older than 30 months. Meyer said the target age is older because cattle can carry the BSE disease up to 90 months. USDA will be working with officials at slaughter houses, farms and livestock auctions to find cattle in the high-risk population, as well as cattle farmers. Meyer said there is also a tracking system for cattle that makes it easy to trace back where the animals came from. Testing of animals will be done using ELISA, which is a rapid screening test that gives officials quick results. USDA is working with various laboratories across the country, including in Washington state, to provide test results. Meyers said any inconclusive results will be double-checked at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa"}

BRUNELL Louisiana has 16 chronically failing public schools, 15 of which are in the city of New Orleans. After years of infighting and finger pointing, the state has finally taken a bold step to solve the problem. The state of Louisiana took over a public school. If we don't stick to our 1992 school reforms here in Washington, the same thing could happen here. The P.A. Capdau Middle School had floundered for years. Last spring, more than half of its eighth-graders failed the LEAP test, Louisiana's version of Washington's WASL. The school's seventh-graders fared even worse, scoring lower than 81 percent of their peers nationwide on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The school has had eight principals in the last 10 years and changed its education programs three times in the past three years. In April, following years of warnings and second chances, the state took over the school and turned it over to the University of New Orleans. The University has had a plan in place since 2001 to create a charter school district of as many as ten troubled schools, but opposition from the School Board and the teachers union stopped the plan dead in its tracks. But with Capdau, the University finally got its chance to try a different approach. The changes came swiftly. Using a 250,000 donation from a local bank, the University gave the neglected school a fresh coat of paint, repaired leaky ceilings and installed new lights to brighten its dark and dingy hallways. Next, the University hired a veteran local principal with a get-tough reputation, replaced all but one of Capdau's teachers, and implemented a new curriculum that tailors instruction to each student. The idea is to help students learn at their own pace, rather than promote them to the next grade whether or not they'd learned the material. As with Washington state's education reforms, Louisiana wants to make sure its high school diplomas are more than just a record of attendance. With the curriculum in place, the search for students and teachers began. More than 500 students applied for the 264 spaces available at the school. Students were selected by lottery from applicants who lived within a five-mile radius of the school. The grandmother of two students selected for Capdau told state and school officials that the school takeover was the answer to her prayers. Teachers were not as impressed. Applications to work at Capdau came in slowly. Soured by years of failed school reform efforts, teachers were wary of signing on to yet another experiment in education reform. Eventually, University officials overcame their concerns, and more than 60 teachers applied for 16 available teaching positions. At a training session two weeks before the start of school, teachers were warned to discard their old ideas. \"Perception is reality,\" the trainer warned, and if they expected their students to be unruly and incapable, the students would respond to those expectations. \"I want you to grab those perceptions,\" said the trainer, \"and toss them on the floor.\" Of course, the teachers aren't na ve; they understand the difficulty of their challenge. But they are optimistic that they and the University will be able to change the lives of hundreds of students for the better. The school year at the new Capdau Charter School has just begun. This year, they're focusing on K-3 and the 7th and 8th grades, but eventually, Capdau will be a K-8 school. Parents, teachers and elected officials throughout Louisiana and the nation are watching closely. A success at Capdau could serve as a model for thousands of failing schools across the country. In New Orleans, a single charter school has brought hope and optimism to hundreds of parents. On Nov. 2, Washington voters will decide whether to keep our state's charter schools alternative. By approving Referendum 55, we can ensure that parents and children in our state have an alternative to failing schools. Don C. Brunell is President of the Association of Washington Business"}

A recent graduate of Oregon State University, Crum has been in Alderwood for the past nine months, offering lines of credit to area farmers and agriculture-related businesses. \"I come from a long line of farmers,\" he told the group, saying his grandfather and father are wheat farmers in the small community of Ione, near Hermiston, Ore. \"It's a town of 250 people and I graduated with 10 people in my high school class,\" he said. \"I know ag-communities,\" he added. \"But my father discouraged me from becoming a farmer,\" he added. But unable to stay away from agriculture, Crum decided on a career that offers financial aid to farmers like his dad. Crum attended Blue Mountain Community College before transferring to Oregon State, where he earned a degree in agriculture business. \"I like crushing numbers and going out and kicking tires with farmers,\" he said. He said the Farm Credit Service has a long history of offering farmers low interest loans. Crum said he sees his job as a way to help maintain the security of the nation's food supply. \"We help to keep agriculture in America,\" Crum said. He said the Alderwood branch of the Farm Credit Service is part of the Northwest Farm Credit Service, which is one of five credit unions located throughout the United States. Crum said in addition to offering farmers low interest lines of credit for their farming operations, the Farm Credit Service also offers farm business classes for young farmers, incentives for staying in farming and low interest housing loans. \"Our agency has been around for 85 years, setting the lending standards for dealing with farmers.

This was how a wet Monday night went for the Alderwood High School freshman football team against visiting Wapato. The Grizzlies pounded Wapato 56-20 last night to improve to 5-2 on the season heading into next Monday's game at Ellensburg. Alderwood's lone touchdown in the opening quarter was a 23-yard pass play from quarterback Adrian Cantu to Frank Salcedo. The Grizzlies made good on a two-point conversion attempt to lead 8-0. The second quarter saw the Grizzlies tack on two more scores. Cantu scooted in from three yards out and the other touchdown was a 22-yard pass play from Cantu to Jessie Montelongo. Alderwood padded its 22-0 lead with three touchdowns in the third quarter. The first was a 15-yard touchdown pass from Cantu to Brice Rinehold. Montelongo scored next on a 41-yard run. Alderwood's last score of the third quarter was a 38-yard touchdown pass from Cantu to Joseph Villanueva. Grizzly freshman coach Glenn Braman went to his bench late in the third quarter. After that, the Wolfpack took advantage of some less experienced players being in the game, scoring three rushing touchdowns. Wapato made good on one of three two-point conversion attempts. Alderwood added two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter. Cantu scored on a 70-yard run. The Grizzlies missed the extra point attempt. The last touchdown was from Montelongo, who ran 82 yards for the score. Braman said Alderwood wasn't trying to score a lot of touchdowns against Wapato, but rather the Grizzlies were trying to work on executing some plays. Villanueva had a nice night for Alderwood, rushing for 144 yards on 14 carries. Montelongo had 139 yards on six totes. Cantu rushed eight times for 90 yards. Cantu also was 9-for-15 in the air for 219 yards"}

Jim Honeyford and Representatives Bruce Chandler and Dan Newhouse also talked about concerns they have with the WASL, school funding, charter schools and the future of education in the state. Ian Grabenhorst, assistant superintendent for ESD 105, listed some concerns the educational district holds. Amongst the educational priorities Grabenhorst outlined were a focus on amply funding K-12 education. He suggested the state complete a comprehensive review of the finance system and establish a sustainable, predictable and fair state funded system for public schools. Making a constitutional amendment that would allow school districts to pass a levy with a simple majority is also key to better education in Washington, said Grabenhorst. He asked the state legislators to consider repealing unfunded mandates, which are difficult to implement without funding in place. \"We have requests that are set in front of our districts and no funding,\" said Grabenhorst. He also asked the legislators to oppose binding arbitration and to reinforce the state's \"no strike\" laws. Sen. Honeyford, in his opening comments, said one of the major issues facing the legislature this budget cycle is money. \"We'll have at least a 1 billion deficit, plus collective bargaining. We'll probably be a billion-two upside down to start with,\" he said. He explained that K-12 education receives about 43 percent of the state's budget and another 10 percent goes to higher education. Corrections receives about 30 percent, leaving the state with about 20 percent of the money as discretionary. Honeyford said they have had difficulties getting the votes to make strikes illegal, but they are still working on it. He said he believes that questions about the WASL will once again return to the state level this next year. \"The WASL to some people is the holy grail to end education problems,\" said Honeyford. \"I don't like it. It's terribly expensive for what we get.\" Another concern is non-English speakers and the disabled taking the test. Chandler takes a different view on the test. He believes there has to be some kind of benchmark or test to see the educational growth. \"I believe at the end of the day most students will achieve our expectations of them,\" he said. \"If we expect great things they will rise to that.\" He added that he believes there is a lot to be said for better than average students. Chandler said a K-12 task force has been looking at education in the state and one of the areas it found of interest is special education funding. \"In areas some districts are making money on it and others are in the hole,\" said Chandler. Chandler said if Initiative 884 going before voters to help fund public education is passed it will be the highest tax increase in the history of the state. He said that if the initiative fails that most likely the legislators will be reluctant to increase taxes. \"If it passes it will probably be the only tax increase passed mainly because of its size,\" said Chandler. A concern Chandler has with the initiative is that if the 1 percent increase in retail sales tax for K-12 education is put in a fund and decided upon by a citizen oversight committee, he foresees the legislature having very little input on public education. One of Newhouse's main concerns is the class of 2008 being required to pass the WASL to graduate. \"There's concern about the dropout rate if we don't do anything about it,\" said Newhouse. But, some changes may be afoot at the state level. Currently, there are 25 Republicans in the Senate and 24 Democrats. With four close races, Honeyford feels it's too close to call what it will be like next year. The House of Representatives has 52 Democrats and 46 Republicans. \"That six-vote difference was determined in the last election by 1,700 people,\" said Chandler. \"This year we expect voter turnout to exceed 70 percent. Ten percent of voters in Yakima County could be new voters, which creates a lot of uncertainty.\" Local pastor and a member of the Alderwood School District's ethics committee, Ron Jetter, addressed the trend to combat obesity at the school level by banning certain foods and beverages from school grounds. He asked if the legislators anticipate a state law that would ban certain foods. Chandler said that last year two bills in the House addressed child obesity. One of the bills would have banned certain foods from being sold on school grounds. The other, known as the \"Fat Tax,\" would have taxed foods based on ingredients. The problem, he said, is that some candy bars would be taxed and others wouldn't. Chandler anticipates at least one proposal this year, but he would much rather leave it at the school board level. In all, the legislators are looking forward to an interesting session. They said they appreciated the input from those who are on the front line of education, which helps them in their decision making process in Olympia. The light at the end of the tunnel, Honeyford added at the end, is that the economic downfall the state has been experiencing is expected to end in 2009. He anticipates programs that have been neglected with funding, such as education, will receive more funding. . Mel Sacher can be contacted at (509) 837-4500, or e-mail msacher@hawkpress.com"}

The two-headed monster of Greg Gilleland and Joe Schwartz did most of the damage for the Grizzlies, as they helped record a commanding 42-21 victory over the Wolfpack. \"I thought we played well,\" said Alderwood Coach Mark Marro, \"but we didn't hold onto the ball.\" Alderwood got on the board early in the game when Gilleland returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown. The Grizzlies' other early score came in the first quarter when Gilleland popped off a 20-yard touchdown run. The fun for Grizzly fans didn't stop with the end of the first quarter, as Alderwood scored twice in the second period. Gilleland scored both second quarter touchdowns, one off a one-yard run and the other a 22-yard pass from quarterback Tony Cantu. The Wolfpack was able to sustain a drive in the second quarter that led to a touchdown, when Wapato quarterback Jason Pitt found receiver Mark McDaniel on a five-yard pass. The second half was sort of a different story for the Grizzlies, as they didn't look anything like they did in the opening two quarters. The second half saw the Grizzlies fumble three times inside the Wolfpack's 20-yard line. \"We can't afford to cough up the ball,\" said Marro. Wapato took advantage of the slippery hands of the Grizzlies in the second half. The Wolfpack drove nearly the length of the field in the third quarter to see the drive end on a one-yard touchdown run from Art Weaver. With the score 28-14, the Grizzlies got back to pounding the ball on the ground. Gilleland scored on a four-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Teammate Joe Schwartz added a 17-yard touchdown run to account for the final score. Wapato's Justin Clements gave the Wolfpack its last score when he ran past the Grizzly defense on a 74-yard touchdown run. The Grizzlies did a nice job of keeping Wapato's defense guessing. Alderwood was able to mix in an effective passing game with a dominating run attack. Cantu went 10-for-16 on the night through the air for 186 yards. \"We wanted Tony to throw the ball,\" said Marro. \"We are going to need him to throw the ball in the next couple of weeks.\" Marro said he was impressed with the way Wapato played, as the Wolfpack was putting some hard hits on the Grizzlies. \"They have steadily gotten better,\" said Marro. Marro was also impressed with the play of his offensive line, which opened holes for Gilleland and Schwartz all night. Gilleland ended up rushing for 158 yards on 24 carries while Schwartz had 101 yards off 14 totes. Gilleland also had two receptions for 67 yards. Gilleland set a new school record for most points scored in a game. Gilleland scored 30 points on Friday night, breaking Larry Coleman's record set in 1979 of 26 points against East Valley-Spokane. Gilleland also tied the record with a host of other players for most rushing touchdowns in a game with three. One Alderwood player who performed extremely well Friday night was Noe Zamarron, who was both a force on the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. Zamarron had three catches for 52 yards. \"He has great hands,\" said Marro. \"Noe is an exceptional athlete.\" The only drawback in the game that Marro saw was the fumbles by Alderwood in the second half. Marro also felt his defensive unit could have done a better job of tackling in the second half. \"We missed a lot of tackles,\" said Marro. Besides the fumbles, Marro felt his team did an exceptional job of playing the game. \"We got pretty much what we expected from the players,\" said Marro. Alderwood (2-2, 4-3) will be without the services of Gilleland for a crucial Mid-Valley League match-up at Ellensburg. Gilleland was ejected late from Friday's game for an altercation with a Wapato player. \"It is always a tough place to play at Ellensburg,\" said Marro. \"I am excited about the game.\" Marro said the game against Ellensburg is a must win if Alderwood wants to stay in playoff contention. .

With the exception of one defensive breakdown, the Greyhounds kept Toppenish in check for most of the night. \"We had everyone up blitzing on that one breakdown,\" said Grandview Coach Justin Lamb. Toppenish running back Ramon Garza, who led all rushers in the game with just over 160 yards, squirted past the oncoming blitzers and raced 77 yards for a TD. The Wildcats added their only other score of the night just before halftime. Tomas Suarez capped off the scoring drive with a 3-yard plunge into the end zone. But by the time Suarez found pay dirt, Grandview already had a commanding 28-6 lead on the 'Cats. The 'Hounds, who went into the locker room at intermission up 28-12, added two touchdowns after the break to account for the 42-12 drubbing. Lamb said his defensive unit did a solid job of shutting down Toppenish in the second half. \"Especially the two goal line stands we had in the second half, when Toppenish still had their first unit in there. We had a mixture of first and second unit players on the field, and our kids held when Toppenish had the ball deep on our end of the field,\" Lamb said. The Grandview coach went on to single out senior Ryan Dill, who played well, said Lamb, from his cornerback spot. Dill basically killed one Toppenish scoring opportunity when he intercepted a pass in the end zone. He returned the ball about 30 yards to give the 'Hounds good field position. Scoring-wise for Grandview, senior Silas Hansen rushed for three touchdowns on the night. Quarterback Brandon Artz, a junior, had two TD throws, both to James Vela. \"It was our third straight week of having a rusher over 120 yards,\" said Lamb, speaking of Hansen's performance. \"Our offensive line is finally getting it done.\" In assessing Artz's play, Lamb said his quarterback was \"...really solid. With a good running game, Brandon is finding some time back there to throw the ball,\" Lamb said. Friday's win over the Wildcats upped Grandview's CWAC South record to 3-2, 3-4 overall. The 'Hounds close out regular season play this coming Friday at home against league leading East Valley (4-0, 7-0). \"Oh yeah, East Valley is going to provide us a challenge,\" Lamb said. \"They're as efficient and disciplined as any team I've seen. \"We're just going to try to improve on what we're already doing well,\" he added. .

They no longer are. Mabton bullied the Billy Goats enroute to scoring a 35-17 conference victory. \"It was big,\" said Mabton Coach D.J. Search. \"We out-physicaled them. \"The coaches and kids did a good of watching film last week. We were all confident we were going to be more physical than them,\" Search said. Search credits his offensive and defensive lines for taking control of the game. \"Both lines played outstanding,\" he said. Defensively, Mabton limited Pateros to just 86 rushing yards. The Billy Goats did gain about 150 yards through the air, although the Pateros QB, Zahn, was picked once. The interception was claimed by Mabton free safety Ryan Harris. Search explained that Pateros employed a spread offense against his club, often times using pro sets in the backfield. \"We just played assignment defense against them,\" he said. \"We stayed in our 5-3 defense, except on 3rd and long plays when we jumped into something else. \"We were very physical against them,\" Search added. \"Our whole defense did their job. They came to play. Tackling was very good.\" Offensively, the Vikings' line was just as physical, which resulted in some large holes being opened for Mabton's running backs. The Vikes' leading ground gainers were Pablo Sanchez, Alex Zavala and Ray Elizondo. Sanchez tallied 108 yards on the ground on 13 carries. Zavala scooted for 93 yards on 10 totes, and Elizondo ran the ball 11 times for 61 yards. Mabton QB Ryan Harris didn't have to air it out much Friday night. He only attempted nine passes, completing three of them for 80 yards. Zavala had two of the receptions, accouting for 72 of the 80 passing yards. The Vikes opened a 14-0 lead on Pateros with two first quarter scores. Sanchez had the first TD, that coming on a 61-yard breakaway run. Harris had a 2-yard dive for the second touchdown. Pateros countered with a 39-yard TD pass late in the opening quarter to cut Mabton's lead to 14-6. The Vikes responded in the second quarter, though, punching in two more touchdowns to build their lead to 28-6. Jovanni Ochoa, on his only carry of the game because Sanchez's helmet was broken, scored the first of the two TD's on a 3-yard plunge. The other touchdown came on Sanchez's second score of the night, a 9-yard scamper. Pateros closed the gap to 28-10 just before the half on a 28-yard field goal. Mabton added an insurance score in the third quarter when Zavala broke loose and raced 16 yards for a TD. Marco Zepeda followed up the touchdown with his fifth consecutive successful PAT kick of the night. The Billy Goats got a second TD pass from Zahn in the final quarter to account for the final 35-17 score. Last Friday's win improved Mabton's South Central 'B' League record to 4-2, 5-2 overall. The Vikings are scheduled to play a non-league game at Highland (3-4) this coming Friday. Pateros slipped to 4-1 in conference play with the loss, and the Billy Goats still have to play league leading Waterville (5-0). .

Students in Erica Barrom's class spent most of Friday afternoon rechinking Ben Snipes cabin at the corner of Grant Avenue and South Fourth Street. \"We came to fill in the cracks,\" said fifth grader Carlos Cardenas. The students spent more than an hour up to their elbows in a mud and straw mixture that they used to fill in the spaces between the logs of the cabin. The students gave it their all as they pushed their hands into the crevices in the building, ensuring the mud mixture was securely in place. Barrom said the rechinking served as a way for the students to get involved in the community. She explained that when Bill Flower mentioned the idea of rechinking the cabin to her husband, Jeff Barrom, she decided to bring the idea to her class. Barrom said she asked her students if they would be interested in rechinking the more than 150-year-old cabin, and the answer was a resounding yes. According to Barrom, before her students arrived at the cabin they went through a little bit of preparation in the classroom. She said they talked about what chinking is and the importance of volunteering. She added that once the students arrived at the cabin Flower gave them an oral presentation on the history of Alderwood and the significance of the cabin. After watching her students jump head first into the rechinking project, Barrom said it was nice to see her students not afraid to get a little dirty. Barrom added that this is one of several volunteer projects her classroom has taken part in. She said that her students also make monthly visits to Hillcrest Manor, where they meet with the residents. Ed Werkhoven, president of the Alderwood Daybreak Rotary Club, which oversees the historic cabin, said Ben Snipes cabin typically has to be rechinked every three years. He noted that the interval between chinking the cabin depends on how much the sun beats down on the building, which causes the mud mixture to dry up and crack. Werkhoven said it was nice to see a group of students who were so interested in helping maintain the cabin. \"These kids really got into it,\" Werkhoven said. \"They're not afraid to get a little dirty.\" .

{"Id":"1101162622734","Title":"County commissioner candidates participate in forum","Author":"John Panni","Time":"10/15/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"GRANDVIEW - Former Alderwood City Councilman Chad Werkhoven served as moderator for a political forum Thursday night in Grandview, which featured candidates running for Yakima County commissioner positions. Three candidates featured at the forum, sponsored by the Grandview Kiwanis Club, were Mike Leita, Republican, Erv Wandler, Constitution Party of Yakima, and Earl S. Lee, Democrat. All three candidates are vying for the open position being left by current Yakima County Commissioner Tim June in district one. The other candidates last night were current district two Yakima County Commissioner Tom Camay, Republican, and Independent candidate Sandra Swanson. Yakima Mayor Paul George, Democrat, was unable to be in attendance last night. Each of the candidates were given a couple of minutes to introduce themselves. Leita said he was raised in Yakima and is a graduate of Washington State University with a business degree. \"I am fully committed to this process,\" said Leita, referring to his commitment to becoming a county commissioner. \"We do need new leadership.\" Leita concentrated for a minute on the problems facing Yakima County, especially from the fiscal end. Leita said to help with the fiscal issues he would promote a business attitude within the county. Wandler was direct in his comments to the audience last night. \"If you elect me, I will never let you down,\" Wandler smiled. Wandler said the problem with county government is officials say they hear the problems of the people, but they never address the issues. Lee, one of 13 children raised in Yakima by his parents, cited his extensive education background as one of the reasons why he should be elected to office. \"I have dealt with every issue,\" said Lee. Lee said he has dealt with issues from agriculture to education to business in Yakima County for years. One of the areas Lee would focus on if elected county commissioner would be to do more grant writing. Lee believes the county hasn't utilized grants enough. \"I know how to get you money,\" said Lee. Lee said he also wanted to stress the importance of the county working together with residents. \"The key to a community and success is we all work together,\" said Lee. Swanson is a native of Wapato. She has a varied background, which includes working in the agriculture field and running a small business. Swanson was at the forefront fighting several measures government officials in Yakima tried to implement, including a tax issue that would have cost residents millions of dollars and the formation of a port district. Swanson spoke proudly of how she is not affiliated with any of the parties. \"That is what I bring to the table, an independent voice,\" Swanson said. Camay, a Toppenish resident, spoke about his knowledge of issues facing people in the county, including matters facing farmers, citing his 34 years in the industry. \"I care about what happens to the people of Yakima County,\" said Camay. \"I am committed to my job.\" Camay cited the successes of the county commissioners in recent years, including their work in helping bringing in the Wal-Mart distribution center to Grandview. The forum then switched to each of the candidates answering questions from the audience. One of the first questions focused on the 3/10's of 1 percent sales tax Yakima County Sheriff Ken Irwin is proposing to fund law and justice services and whether the candidates were in favor of the issue. Camay said commissioners decided to leave the issue of the sales tax to the people, who will vote on the matter in the upcoming election. Camay said the sales tax idea is a viable solution to help with funding law and justice matters. Camay said law and justice eats up 82 percent of the county's yearly budget. \"This is something I could never vote for,\" said Swanson. Swanson said the sales tax issue will take millions of dollars out of the county's economy yearly. Swanson suggested the county look at bombarding the state legislature to get back the 42 of every law and justice dollar spent that goes to the state. Lee said he is not in favor of the tax either. He felt a more productive way to save money would be to eliminate the overtime the county has a problem controlling. Lee said officers should be rewarded with comp time. Lee also felt privatization could be utilized with the sheriff's department to save taxpayers millions of dollars. Wandler said addressing law enforcement would be a priority of his. Wandler said where the county ran into problems with law and justice was it spent money it didn't have for various programs. Leita said he would support whatever the people decided on the tax. But he wasn't necessarily in favor of the tax, feeling the county was looking at a short-term solution to addressing money problems. Another question had to do with the county possibly shutting down the parks department. Swanson felt there is no reason the county should close the parks when it is such a small part of their budget. She felt that parks would be another ideal area for privatization services. \"I am convinced we can keep our parks open,\" said Swanson. \"There are many ways to keep the parks open,\" said Lee. Lee felt the county could work with different training agencies to utilize people to take care of the parks. Wandler didn't offer much of a suggestion on how to keep the parks open. Leita also suggested privatizing to keep the parks system going. Leita said he felt the commissioners should look else where to make budget cuts before cutting the parks department. Camay said the county is doing its best to keep the parks department open, but money is tight. Camay said the county is looking at ways to make a profit from the parks. \"We are trying to do the best we can with what we have,\" said Camay. One of the hot topics addressed had to do with the jail debacle the county is currently going through. Leita said if he was elected commissioner his first order of duty would be to finish construction on the 288-bed jail, the first phase of the project. He would then halt construction and form a committee to examine ways the county allegedly mishandled the jail construction project. \"It is a solution to a problem,\" said Camay. \"We are going to run out of jail space in the next 10 years and that is a fact.\" Camay said the jail project has no fiscal impact on the county's general budget, as it is being paid for with bonds commissioners approved. Camay said the jail project will help the county fiscally. Swanson said she would also finish construction on the first phase of the jail project, but halt matters after that. She said the county is going to have financial problems paying for the jail because of the competition for jail space. \"We need to stop and take a whole new look at this,\" said Swanson. Lee cited the financial problems the county will have with the jail, which is expected to lose nearly 2 million in its first couple of years of operation. Lee said both the Tri-Cities and Ellensburg are working on jail facilities that will cut into the county financially. Wandler said he was under the impression the current jail facility was more than adequate for Yakima County. He said he felt the county bit off more than it could chew with the jail project"}
{"Id":"1101162622968","Title":"Guest Editorial","Author":"Webmaster","Time":"10/15/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"ROBERT DE POSADA Once again, the U.S. Census found that the number of uninsured Americans has increased, this time to 45 million - an increase of 1.4 million from last year. As the cost of health insurance increases, many employers are dropping coverage, leaving millions of Americans to buy their own coverage. In fact, the same census report found that those covered by employer provided coverage dropped to 60 percent of the population, down from 2003 numbers. This hits the minority community the hardest. Latinos and African-Americans account for more than 50 percent of the uninsured population-one out of every three Latinos is uninsured and about one out of every five African-Americans. The tax code has favored employer-provided health insurance for the last 60 years, and in that time, this important benefit has enabled most Americans to get health insurance from their employers. Workers who buy their own health insurance are the only people who don't get a tax break when and if they buy health insurance. This year, employer-provided and self-employed health insurance will enjoy a 155 billion tax break. It is fundamentally unfair that workers are discriminated against by the federal tax code in their purchase of health insurance simply because they buy a policy outside their place of employment. With the jump in the uninsured, surely there should be political momentum behind helping the uninsured get health insurance. But with the campaign season in full swing, the people who desperately need access to affordable health insurance will have to wait until after the next election to get any help at all, unless Congress does something right away. Congress could pass a bill now that would provide relief to workers. This bill, known as \"Fair Care for the Uninsured,\" would provide money for the purchase of health insurance- 1,000 for an individual, 2,000 for a couple, and 3,000 for a family, each year. President Bush has provided funding for this money in his budget. Fair Care would correct the discrimination built into the tax code that currently gives unlimited tax benefits to those who purchase health insurance through their employer, but no tax benefit to the individual purchaser. The money provided under Fair Care would be advanced to workers up front so that they would have money to buy health insurance, and, according to Fiscal Associates, 18.6 million uninsured people could buy health insurance. During this presidential campaign, the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, has suggested other ways to help the uninsured, such as a tax break for small businesses, extending Medicaid to cover low-income children, and enabling workers to buy into health coverage programs for federal employees. However, in 19 years in the Senate, Mr. Kerry has not introduced legislation to address the uninsured crisis. But today he can change that by marching right down to the Senate and adding his name to the Fair Care bill. He doesn't have to wait to make more empty campaign promises. He can make his dream to help the uninsured a reality by immediately supporting this bipartisan legislation. Perhaps it's because Senator Kerry is worth 169 million and gets tax-free health insurance from the federal government. The Florida Times-Union indicated in a recent editorial that Mr. Kerry \"may not see it [the uninsured] as a problem. Admittedly, [Fair Care] would not appeal to those who want to turn health care entirely over to the government, hang the cost.\" Most politicians think reducing the number of uninsured is a good thing. Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress think Fair Care is a good idea and support the legislation. National groups representing Hispanics, small employers and farmers support Fair Care. While some policymakers would like to consign a large number of America's working poor to Medicaid, or some expanded version of Medicaid in which individuals and families will only get the benefits government officials give them, Fair Care is a superior alternative, which would not bust the federal budget and continue to choke state budgets across the country. The best option is to change the tax treatment of health insurance and give low-income working families without health insurance money to help them purchase private health insurance best suited for their families.

We had third row seats at the 40 yard line directly behind the NFC All-Stars bench. Even though the Pro Bowl is played every year in February (since 1980), this was our first and only experience. My oldest son and I were intently watching the star-studded game. In the meantime, my wife and youngest son were intently watching the bench, waving at any player who got up to get some Gatorade. In my annoyance, I explained to my wife and youngest that what they were doing was fruitless. \"The players are warned ahead of time not to give the fans any false hope of signing autographs since if you do it for one, you must do it for the other 50,000 in attendance,\" I said. Ignoring me, half of the family continued to wave and try to make eye contact with the players throughout the whole game. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, a player caught my eye as he walked from the Gatorade table toward our row of seats. That player was Michael Bates, who played for the Carolina Panthers as a return specialist. He took off the Panther cap that he was wearing, signed it with a pen and then pointed in our direction. As I traced his finger, I soon realized he was pointing at my youngest son. He then tossed his cap to my son. Needless to say, I was speechless and my own effort to wave at players during the closing minutes of the game was to no avail. My son and the rest of our family have been fans of Michael Bates ever since that day. It only took a minute of his precious time to encourage an eight-year old boy and gain some lifetime fans. The writer of Hebrews records in 10:25 Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another-- and all the more as you see the Day approaching. Hebrews tells us that church involves more than just showing up for services. One of the great functions of church life is encouragement. It means to help others find strength and courage in their life with God. Back in the New Testament setting, members were facing persecution, hardship and turmoil and some were about to give up. A word of hope, a kind deed done in love goes a long way. Almost two thousand years later, not much has changed concerning the need for encouragement. My son still has that cap hanging on his bedroom wall. I need to look at it more often and be reminded of that day when a football player inconvenienced himself, took time and brought cheer to a young boy. I find it far too easy to be negative, sour and fault finding. Encouragement involves focusing on others and willing to be a little inconvenienced. It may mean targeting someone specific at work or at a church service or at the family dinner table. It takes some of your precious time but the impact is far reaching and more than you may ever know. - Pastor Nathan Zakahi of the Alderwood Grace Brethren Church"}

Yesterday, the Alderwood High School cross country team concluded what most will admit is a meaningless conference schedule. On the horizon is the District meet, the first step for those attempting to qualify for this year's State cross country meet. Competing at Ellensburg Thursday afternoon, both the Alderwood boys and girls squads were upended by the host Bulldogs, as well as by West Valley. The Grizzly boys team concluded Mid-Valley League play with a 1-5 record. The Lady Grizzly harriers were 0-6 in league play this season. In the boys race, AHS senior Brenden Scott again proved he will be a force when the postseason races roll around. Scott garnered a second place individual finish in Ellensburg, coming in just six seconds back of the winner-Joe Darda of Ellensburg. Darda's first place finish, coupled with a fourth place individual finish by teammate Isak Bergman and a seventh place showing by the Bulldogs' Jeff Jorgensen, powered Ellensburg to a 21-39 victory over Alderwood. In the West Valley-Ellensburg boys match-up, the Rams prevailed by a 26-33 score. West Valley's top finisher was Richie Williams, third overall in a time of 18:00. Williams was well back of Darda and Scott, who clocked times of 17:19 and 17:25, respectively. The Rams, though, had superior team depth to knock off both Ellensburg and Alderwood in yesterday's match-ups. West Valley claimed the fifth and sixth place individual finishes to go along with Williams' third place showing, and also grabbed the eighth through 12th place individual finishes. Cipriano Meraz had the second fastest time for Alderwood on the Ellensburg course, clocking a 19:26 to earn a 13th place finish. Also competing for the Grizzly boys were Sterling Scott, 22nd in a time of 20:11; Joel Gaspar, 25th in 20:28; Gregg Burbidge, 39th in 22:02; Dane Schmick, 57th in 25:34; Lance Warner, 62nd in 26:20; and Kevin Lick, 63rd in 27:47. In Thursday's girls race, the Lady Grizzlies were beaten 20-43 by West Valley and 21-39 by Ellensburg. The overall individual winner was Michelle Schubert of West Valley, who recorded a time of 20:25. The Rams claimed the top seven individual finishes. Mercedes Martinez was Alderwood's top finisher. She clocked a 24:22 to earn an 11th place finish. Also competing for the Lady Grizzlies were Christina Fuller, 23rd in 30:48; Angelina Fernandez, 24th in 30:59; Andrea Benitez, 27th in 31:23; and Brenda Mora, 30th in 35:25.

{"Id":"1101162623703","Title":"Guest Editorial","Author":"Webmaster","Time":"10/13/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"DON C. BRUNELL In September, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed legislation that would have raised that state's minimum wage from 6.75 to 7.25 per hour in January and 7.75 in 2006. Meanwhile, Washington's Department of Labor and Industries announced that our state's starting wage will increase to 7.35 starting next year. Washington's minimum wage is already the highest in the country. It is no coincidence that Washington's unemployment rate is also among the highest in the nation. On an hourly basis, Washington's minimum wage will exceed Oregon and Alaska by 25 cents, California by 65 cents and Idaho by 2.20. The truth of the matter is Washington's new minimum wage is closer to 9 an hour and, for some industries, is now over 10 per hour because of employer payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance, Social Security and workers' comp. Unless Washington's Legislature acts in 2005, our minimum wage will automatically go up again in 2006. These automatic increases were part of a union backed initiative that passed in 1998 which mandates annual cost-of-living increases in the minimum wage based on the federal Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. In other words, our state's minimum wage is pegged to wage-rates in Seattle without regard for regional differences in rural parts of the state. Take Dayton, Wa. for example. In Dayton, the world's largest asparagus processing plant will close after next summer's harvest because it cannot compete with cheaper Peruvian asparagus. Part of the reason is Washington's high minimum wage. So, while Washington voters may have had the best of intentions when they passed the automatic wage increases, our high minimum wage has helped kill 50 full-time jobs and 1,000 seasonal jobs in Dayton. That's not what the voters had in mind. California, a state with a heavy dependence on agriculture, would also be hurt by a minimum wage hike. In vetoing the recent legislation, Gov. Schwarzenegger rightfully acknowledged that increasing the state's minimum wage makes it too expensive for employers to hire inexperienced workers or provide jobs for young people and seniors. And remember, small businesses create most of the jobs in this country. In essence, raising the minimum wage ever higher forces farmers and small businesses to cut jobs, replace workers with machines, or simply close up shop. The problem will get worse unless legislators take bold action next year to change the law. They need to do four things to change our state's minimum wage law before it further erodes our state's job base:1) Repeal the automatic cost-of-living increase and raise minimum wage rates only when warranted; 2) Freeze the minimum wage at 7.35 until competing states catch up; 3) Treat the minimum wage the same way we treat prevailing wages in Washington-tie it to local economies; and 4) Establish a lower short-term training wage and a lower minimum wage for anyone under age 18 to encourage employers to offer job opportunities to disadvantaged and young workers. While increasing the minimum wage may have seemed like a good idea, it has ended up hurting the very people it was supposed to help. That's called \"the law of unintended consequences.\" Legislators need to change the law next session. Don C. Brunell is President of the Association of Washington Business"}

At the end of the school year she made a proposal to Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones, who approved creating the new position. Froese competed against several others during the hiring process, but in the end was hired. For eight years Froese was employed as a teacher in the Alderwood School District. Four of the years she taught sixth grade and the other four she had a fourth grade classroom, so she knows about the testing processes the students undergo every year. She has had classrooms of students take the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) test, as well as a plethora of other tests used to assess students. Her familiarity with the tests and testing process has helped her as she looks at test results from the WASL, MAP (Measures of Academic Progress), Iowa Test of Basic Skills and other tests used to measure students' progress. Froese explained that the district decided that now that it has all the information, it hired her to find a way to use it and make it user friendly. \"I do a lot of graphing so administrators have a visual and it makes more sense,\" said Froese. Part of what she does is a correlation study between MAP testing results and WASL results. \"We hope to predict individuals who have a chance of passing WASL but maybe need a little extra help,\" said Froese. By comparing the two tests, she hopes they will be able to see gaps in the curriculum that will help students in the testing processes. Froese explained that both the WASL and the MAP tests cover broad areas and have several strands to them. She said that by comparing strands and finding trends they can find weaknesses and fill it with supplemental material. To start off, Froese is looking at the test scores as a whole and the trends. In the future she hopes to be as individualized as being able to find individual students consistently scoring low and finding them the extra help they need to pass the tests. Although right now Froese is working primarily with school district principals, she hopes to work more with parents and students in the future. \"I hope to work more with them so they have a better understanding of why we're taking all these tests,\" said Froese. Her job description has her working with students from kindergarten through 12th grade, but Froese said most of the assessments occur between third and 10th grades. Froese misses working with students, but she said she is enjoying her new position. Currently, she is mapping the school district's Grade Level Expectation's (GLE), which are tasks students should be able to complete at each grade level. She explained that the GLE's are used to focus instruction. She hopes this will be the first step to refining the curriculum, meeting the needs and doing away with gaps and deficits in the learning materials used by the school district"}

I thought we played a total game.\" A lot of the success for Friday night's victory can be attributed to the offensive line of Alderwood, which opened the running game of the Grizzlies. Alderwood's offensive line allowed Greg Gilleland and Joe Schwartz to run all over Hanford's defense. Gilleland had a very impressive night for Alderwood, racking up 211 yards on 26 totes and two rushing touchdowns, while Schwartz had 155 yards on 21 carries. \"They ran the ball well,\" said Marro of his two backs. \"I am real happy with how they performed.\" Alderwood scored in the opening quarter when Gilleland scampered in for a touchdown from seven yards out. The Falcons also got on the board in the first quarter when a Grizzly fumble gave Hanford a short field to work with for a touchdown. Alderwood was able to block the extra point attempt by the Falcons to lead 7-6 at the end of the first quarter. Gilleland had his second touchdown of the night in the second quarter when he scored on a 15-yard run. The Grizzlies took a 14-6 lead into the locker room at halftime. The second half opened with a quiet third quarter as neither team could find the back of the end zone. Alderwood, though, exploded for 10 points in the fourth quarter to put the game out of reach. Grizzly kicker Pete Marquez nailed a 23-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. Alderwood's final score came off a 25-yard interception return for a touchdown by Gilleland. The Grizzlies didn't put the ball in the air very much Friday night as quarterback Tony Cantu completed only 3-of-5 passes for 20 yards. Marro said Alderwood didn't throw the ball much because the ground game was working so well. \"We were getting five to 20 yards a run,\" said Marro. Marro said what was key for the Grizzlies on Friday night was they were able to control the line of scrimmage, which he said dictated the pace of the game. Marro also gave credit to Alderwood's defense for its efforts on Friday night in shutting down the Falcons. The Grizzlies (1-2, 3-3) will be hosting Wapato this coming Friday in Alderwood's Homecoming game.

Just ask the Grandview High School football team. \"We had some kids that were sore after the game,\" confirmed Grandview Coach Dustin Lamb. Despite the bumps and bruises sustained by the Greyhounds last Friday, Grandview stole a Central Washington Athletic Conference victory away from Naches on the Rangers' home field. Riding the pinpoint passing of Brandon Artz, who tossed three touchdown passes, the 'Hounds eked out a 30-21 win. Friday's victory squares Grandview's CWAC South record at 2-2 on the season. Naches slipped to 1-2 in league play. Lamb said the win will go a long way in helping the 'Hounds solidify at least the No. 4 seed into the CWAC playoffs. Grandview (2-2, 2-4) still has league contests remaining against Toppenish (0-3, 1-5) and East Valley (4-0, 6-0). After playing to a scoreless tie in the first quarter, Grandview drew first blood in last Friday's game on a 28-yard TD pass from Artz to James Vela. A 20-yard field goal by Cesar Alvarez later in the second period gave the 'Hounds a 9-0 lead. Naches cut the deficit to 9-6 on the ensuing play, when Dylan Emmons outraced Grandview's kickoff team 95 yards to paydirt. A two-point conversion pass from Justin Weller to Ben Rowan drew the Rangers to within 9-8. Neither club could get much of anything going in the third quarter. But the final period started off with a bang for Grandview, as the 'Hounds struck quickly twice. The first of the two TD's came on a 32-yard pass from Artz to Vela, the second such scoring hook-up in the game. Grandview's Silas Hansen, who led all rushers in the contest with 171 yards on 28 totes, broke off a 28-yarder for the second fourth quarter Greyhound score. Alvarez's two PAT kicks gave Grandview what appeared to be at the time an insurmountable 23-8 lead. But the gutsy Rangers wouldn't go away quietly. Naches countered with a 28-yard TD pass from Weller to Chris Reese, following up the score with another Weller to Reese touchdown connection-the second one a 40-yard scoring strike. The Rangers pulled to within 23-21 of Grandview on the second Weller to Reese hook-up. Naches opted to go for two on the conversion in an attempt to tie the game, but the 'Hounds stuffed the running play to preserve their slim two-point lead. Down the stretch, Grandview ended any suspense that was left when Artz threw for his third TD of the night. The final touchdown toss went to Tony Chester-a 24-yarder. Alvarez's PAT kick accounted for the final 30-21 score. \"Brandon (Artz) had a good game,\" said Lamb. \"The best thing we had going was the balance we showed Friday night. Brandon does well when he has time, and our line did a great job of giving him time.\" Artz ended up completing 11-of-20 passes for 172 yards. Vela and Hansen were his favorite targets, as they combined for seven catches for 112 yards. The balance Lamb spoke of was provided by the Greyhounds' great rushing attack. With superb blocking from the likes of right tackle Cody McMillan, left guard J.R. Camacho and center Andrew Peterson, Grandview tallied 198 yards on the ground. Hansen's 171-yard rushing performance highlighted the ground attack. \"Silas (Hansen) put his ten cents in,\" said Lamb. Heading into Friday's game, Lamb said he knew the Rangers were going to provide a stiff challenge for his team. \"We were very impressed with Naches on film,\" he said. \"They bring it right at you,\" Lamb said of the Rangers' wishbone attack, also praising the 3-5-3 defensive alignment Naches throws at opposing teams. \"Naches hits very hard. They're a touch bunch,\" Lamb said. The Greyhounds, though, proved they're not sissies, either. Defensively, Camacho had the standout performance for Grandview, recording 11 tackles and one quarterback sack. Artz showed he isn't one-dimensional, as he added nine tackles and deflected two passes to go along with his three TD tosses on the night.

The not so big, but very young and physical offensive line of Mabton had its way with Manson, sparking the Vikes to a 27-0 whitewashing of the visitors. The Central Washington 'B' League victory upped Mabton's conference record to 3-2, 4-2 overall. \"Our offensive line played well all night,\" said Mabton Coach D.J. Search. \"We're young on the line, only one senior, but they're physical and very fast. They were opening some huge holes for our rushing attack.\" The linemen in question include senior James Magana and underclassmen Robert Marquez, Ramon Monciviaz, Alex Balli, Vicente Tovar, Adrian Magana and tight end Moises Gutierrez. Search said most of the credit for the 249 yards his club gained on the ground goes to his linemen. \"What a job they did,\" he said. Of course, someone had to blast through the holes Search's offensive linemen were creating. That task went to Pablo Sanchez and Alex Zavala, who combined for 209 rushing yards and between them scored all four of Mabton's touchdowns. Sanchez, who gained a game best 142 yards on 11 carries, scored the first TD of the game on a 35-yard burst. \"It was a simple lead play,\" said Search, explaining that Sanchez followed two running backs and hit the hole his offensive linemen created. Zavala also had a first quarter TD run for the Vikes, capping off a short drive with an 18-yard scamper that came on a counter. Marco Zepeda hit one of two extra point kicks on the two first quarter touchdowns to give Mabton a 13-0 lead. Sanchez added a 91-yard breakaway TD run in the second quarter. Manson, on the previous play, went for it on a 4th-and-1 play from Mabton's 9-yard line. Unable to convert, though, the Vikes took over possession of the ball. On the very next call, Sanchez found daylight and outraced everyone to the end zone. \"It was another counter,\" said Search. \"Our offensive linemen had people on the ground. Pablo (Sanchez) found an opening and just outran everyone.\" Mabton pitched the ball to Zavala on the ensuing 2-point conversion and he bounced into the end zone to up the Vikes' lead to 21-0. The Vikings put an insurance TD on the scoreboard in the third quarter, when Zavala capped off a long drive with a 4-yard TD run. For the most part, Mabton kept the ball on the ground against Manson. QB Ryan Harris, a senior, did air it out seven times, connecting on five of the passes for a total of 62 yards. It was the second straight week Harris wasn't intercepted. \"Ryan went 11-for-16 last week and then had a 5-for-7 night last Friday,\" said Search. \"Not bad passing numbers at all.\" In looking ahead to this coming Friday's game at Pateros, located near Wenatchee, Search said his Vikings may throw the ball a bit more than they did against Manson. \"We know Pateros jams the defensive line with 10 guys,\" Search said. \"So you may see us throwing the ball more. \"On offensive, Pateros likes to spread the field on offense. We'll have to play good assignment football to shut them down. \"Paterson is tied for first in our league with Waterville. It's a game we need to win,\" he added"}

The arrival of the canoe, to be manned by Corps of Discovery re-enactors, is slated for approximately 1 p.m. The Oct. 16 event will commemorate the Corps of Discovery's 1805 experience at the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers. Other activities planned for that Saturday include living history presentations, first-person interpretations, entertainment, artistic displays, a hands-on children's camp, Columbia Plateau tribal dancing and skills demonstrations, guest speakers, nature walks, jet boat rides and more. Living history presentations will include first-person re-enactors portraying Captain Meriwether June, George Drouillard, Patrick Gass, John Collins and Toissant Charbonneau all of whom were members ofthe Corps of Volunteers for Northwest Discovery. Admission and parking for the Oct. 16 eventis free, thanks in part to corporate sponsor Battelle. \"This is a great opportunity for visitors and locals alike to learn about the two cultures that met at this place almost 200 years ago,\" said Kris Watkins, president and CEO of the Tri-Cities Visitor and Convention Bureau. An estimated 200 Native Americans greeted the Corps of Discovery at the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers in October 1805. While in the midst of these Sahaptian-speaking people the explorers traded goods, purchased food, catalogued the local dialects, repaired their equipment and explored the Columbia River to the mouth of the Tapteal, which is known today as the Yakima River. It was also at the Pasco site that the expedition members knew for the first time since entering unchartered territory exactly where they were, as they had found the object of their journey, the Columbia River. Last year, about 4,000 people attended in the inaugural Heritage Day event. This year organizers are expecting more than 5,000 people to Sacajawea State Park.

{"Id":"1101162642281","Title":"USDA deputy secretary treks to Valley for chat with farmers","Author":"Mel Sacher","Time":"10/8/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"TOPPENISH - Gathering input from Washington farmers and agencies working with local farmers, USDA Deputy Secretary Jim Moseley listened and tried to answer questions at a specially called meeting held in Toppenish yesterday. \"I have one primary purpose here,\" said Moseley. \"It is not to answer every single one of your questions, but rather to help you find the answers to that question.\" He said his commitment to farmers is to have someone to serve those in need, and he invited those who feel they aren't receiving the service they need to e-mail him personally. Moseley called the Thursday morning conference a showing of democracy where concerns are brought straight to the top. The listening session was dubbed \"Better Service Through Public Participation.\" \"From the top of the USDA the message has been sent. Things are going to be different without diminishing services,\" said Moseley. Moseley said that some insinuated that the meeting in the Lower Valley was politically motivated, which he added, \"...irritates me.\" \"If we were here for political reasons you'd see a different kind of meeting,\" he said. Moseley said the sessions that have been held in other parts of the United States have already brought changes in the USDA. For two hours Moseley and other USDA officials directly answered concerns raised by those in attendance. Toppenish farmer Melbern Krueger questioned Moseley on what is going to be done with the shrinking number of farmers in the United States. Krueger said there are 3.2 million farmers in the United States and at the present rate in the next three to five years the number of farmers will be cut in half and another 80 percent will retire. \"We're headed for a crisis in this country,\" said Krueger. \"Unfortunately, we are now importing food from third world countries.\" With the current state of terrorism, Krueger said he is concerned that ways to poison the country's food supply will be found. He added that the North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA) has hurt farmers and that water storage is an issue directly affecting the Lower Valley. Krueger said there is a need for tax-free exemptions for food producers. \"It costs us more to produce a product than the value we're getting out of it,\" said Krueger. Krueger said with the price of apples in the supermarket at 1.49 a pound, the farmer is only getting about 15 cents per pound. \"Young people are not going into farming. My son is one of them. I do not want him to go into agriculture,\" Krueger added. Moseley responded to Krueger saying that a great majority of agricultural products in the United States are dependent on NAFTA. Moseley said even 35 percent of his family's pork and soybean operation in Indiana is dependent on trade. \"My grandfather told me something a long time ago,\" said Moseley. \"His comment to me was the land will always be farmed as long as there are resources available.\" One of the resources of major concern, not only in the Western states, but across the country, is water. Moseley believes there is something that pulls people to agriculture. He said he has a daughter who runs the family farm with her husband, and another son who wants to become a farmer. Both of his children watched as Moseley and his wife in 1998 lost 50 percent of the equity they had built over 32 years of farming. He said that year it cost 43 cents a pound to raise pork and they received 10 cents a pound at market. He added that even though there are concerns about food being brought into the USA from around the world, consumers are still buying imported food. \"Consumers are always right, whether we believe they are or not,\" said Moseley. Luz Gutierrez of the Center for Latino Farmers raised concerns to Moseley that not all farmers, especially those who are minority or disadvantaged, are receiving information on benefits and programs the USDA offers. She said Latino farmers are the largest number of new farmers in Washington and many are not receiving the USDA information or are being represented on county boards. She also requested that term limits be imposed on those serving on county boards. Moseley said that in August the county board rules changed and 300 counties with a high number of minorities were required to have a Latino or women on the ballot for the county board positions. \"Latinos want to be farmers,\" said Gutierrez. \"They're knocking down our door.\" She asked that an assessment of the USDA's outreach programs be completed. \"If we don't see them, then they're not doing outreach, and we aren't seeing them,\" said Gutierrez. A beginning Latino farmer who Gutierrez has been working with said he has been filling out lot of paperwork, but hasn't received any answers from the USDA. Gutierrez said the farmer asked why there are special loans for beginning farmers, but in the end all the money ends up in the same pot that benefits long-time farmers. Moseley said it is a policy question and one that needs to be looked at. \"Beginning farmers shouldn't be beginning farmers forever,\" he said, explaining that established farmers should not be eligible for beginning farmer loans and assistance. \"I was a beginning farmer and I have a soft spot in my heart for them.\" A concern of Yakama Reservation farmer Tom Gasseling, who raises hops, apples and mint, is that farmers in Washington can't compete not only internationally, but with other producers in the United States because of yearly raises in minimum wages in the state. \"We also need to have a fair and level playing field here in the United States,\" said Gasseling. \"We don't want a hand-out, we just want some kind of fair and level playing field.\" Retired dairy farmer Hank Vanderstoel of Alderwood also voiced his concerns about having a level playing field in the dairy industry. He said that this year the Northwest dairy farmers were paid the lowest price ever for milk, but the public paid the highest prices for milk. \"That doesn't make sense,\" said Vanderstoel. He added that the push is for larger and larger farming operations. Moseley said that in today's market the size of a farm is based on what it takes for a family to live. But, he added, contrary to belief, the USDA is seeing an increase nationwide is the number of smaller farms that are being started"}

Wednesday's announcement that the city of Alderwood had purchased the 150-acre feedlot from the Monsons didn't include the news that an adjoining 20-acre site will be kept in the family holdings. Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford confirmed yesterday afternoon that the Monsons will continue operating their custom feed operation on that 20-acre parcel of land. \"They will be retaining the milling operation,\" Rockford said. City of Alderwood officials, after several months of serious discussions with the Monson family, struck a deal to purchase the 150-acre feedlot for 2.5 million. The money will be paid in three installments, all tied to the phased closure of the cattle operation and the clean-up of the site. The money to be paid to the Monson family won't be generated by implementing local taxes or fees, or by asking local citizens to approve a bond measure. Instead, the city is making an internal loan to itself, from invested reserves that are currently yielding low returns. At the present time, Rockford said Thursday afternoon, the city has approximately 7 million tied up in invested reserves. As part of the agreement, the Monsons will not have any cattle delivered to the feedlot after February of next year. The sales agreement also stipulates that all of the cattle, which routinely number more than 2,000 on any given day, will be removed from the site no later than Aug. 31 of next year. Most in the community are viewing the purchase of the feedlot, located near the west entrance into Alderwood along Yakima Valley Highway, as positive news. Proponents of the purchase agreement expect an improvement in the air quality, and expect the western corridor into Alderwood to be brightened with either residential, business or industrial developments. Wednesday evening's announcement that a deal had been brokered with the Monson family also included the news that the Monsons will be responsible for the clean-up of the site. That is to include the removal of the corrals and outbuildings on the 150-acre site, as well as the removal of the manure and \"black soil.\" Rockford explained yesterday that the \"black soil\" is the soil that is situated immediately below the accumulation of the cow manure. He further detailed that plans do not include filling in the site with fill dirt. \"We should be able to go in and just level the site,\" Rockford said. Because of the high nitrate level in the soil, as recent test results have indicated, it is highly probable that the city will contract with a local farmer to plant a crop at the site once the clean-up and removal of \"black soil\" is completed. Rockford said a crop such as alfalfa will leach many of the nitrates out of the soil. He added that if the clean-up goes according to the timeline set up in the agreement, a 2006 fall planting is possible. In responding to which party would be responsible for any future claims against the property, ecologically speaking, Rockford said federal statute clearly defines that area of the law. \"Whoever causes any such issue is held responsible,\" he said. Rockford said that is not a concern, though, as tests have revealed there is no ground water contamination at the site. The future development of the 150-acre site is unclear at this time. Rockford said no one has shown an interest thus far in purchasing any of that land from the city, which is how Alderwood officials hope to recoup the 2.5 million they are borrowing from invested reserves"}
{"Id":"1101162643125","Title":"Fire cadet program growing","Author":"Mel Sacher","Time":"10/7/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"It's been nearly a year since the Alderwood Fire Department Volunteer Cadet program was formed and already the group is looking to expand. Originally, six high school students were selected to participate in the program. Of those six, one has graduated and another has moved on, choosing a different path than the fire service program. Program advisor Josh Roe had two positions to fill, which he did this week, he told members of the Alderwood Kiwanis Club Thursday morning. Roe, a firefighter/paramedic for the Alderwood Fire Department, said he anticipates expanding the program to eight cadets in December. Since the cadet program started, Roe said the students have really become part of the department. Career firefighters help the cadets in their training and explain the different aspects of the fire service to them. The cadets have uniforms similar to the firefighters, so they feel part of the program. More importantly, they are learning life-saving skills that they can use when needed, said Roe. One of the first things the cadets did when the program started was take CPR training and advanced first aid classes, which are a requirement of every firefighter in the state, said Roe. The cadets, who have been eased into the department, are signing up for shift assignments throughout the month and have gone on numerous aid calls and to the scenes of car accidents, at which they've been able to assist the firefighters and paramedics with equipment. They haven't been at the fire station when a fire call has gone out, but next week Roe expects the cadets to receive pagers that will let them know when they need to head to the fire department to help with a fire call. Luis Del Angel is one of the newest cadets in the program. Del Angel said he became interested in the program when he heard applications were available at school. \"I really want to experience what it's like to be a firefighter,\" said Del Angel, who added that if he chooses the fire service as a career his cadet training will give him some experience, although he won't be put in dangerous situations at fire scenes. Cadet President Michelle Gonzalez said that the program has been going well for her. \"For me, going out on calls is such a rush. You never know what to expect,\" she said. Gonzalez, who originally wanted to be a flight nurse, is now looking at being a physician's assistant and helping people with psychological issues. She hopes to stay in the Valley following graduation, to work and be a Yakima County volunteer Firefighter, since the volunteer age is lower than the city's requirement. \"I want to stay around here because I am really enjoying the program,\" said Gonzalez. Roe said cadets can stay in the program until they are old enough to become a city volunteer. He added that he understand the cadets are teens and he encourages them to be a kid because this is their only chance to be in high school. \"I also encourage them to go to college,\" he said, adding that fire departments across the nation are looking more and more for firefighters with college degrees. \"That's were you get your paramedic license, as well,\" he added"}

Following a 25-minute specially called executive session Wednesday evening, city officials reconvened into open session and released details on the impending 2.5 million purchase of the cattle feedlot owned by the Monson's. The purchase of the land, located west of Alderwood between Outlook Road and Yakima Valley Highway, is being viewed by many as not only a quality of life improvement for local citizens, but as a way to boost economic development in Alderwood. \"A city can grow by default or by design, and this is by design,\" Torch said. The 2.5 million will be paid to the Monson family in three installments, all tied to the phased closure of the cattle operation and the clean-up of the feedlot. Under the terms of the agreement, the Monson's will not have any more cattle delivered to the feedlot after February of next year. The agreement also stipulates that all cattle will be removed from the feedlot no later than Aug. 31 of next year, and that the clean-up of the site by the feedlot owners will be completed by July 31, 2006. The clean-up is to include the removal of corrals, outbuildings, manure and \"black soil.\" The Monson's have also agreed to not operate a feedlot within a 20-mile radius of Alderwood. Unlike past proposals in recent years to purchase the feedlot, where local citizens would have had to vote in a bond issue to fund the buyout of the property, Alderwood residents aren't being asked to dig into their pockets this time. The city is financing the 2.5 million purchase by making an internal loan to itself, from invested reserves that are yielding low returns. \"We're utilizing our existing cash reserves,\" City Manager Tom Rockford said last night, hastening to point out that raising taxes or implementing fees isn't required to complete the deal. \"It's a real win-win situation,\" Rockford added. He said the city intends on recouping the money it spends on the purchase of the feedlot by reselling the land to developers. As of right now, he said, the intention is not for the city to hold on to any of the property. Rockford detailed that the 150 acres will be available for development as soon as the clean-up is complete and municipal services are extended to the property. Rockford said the agreement with the Monson family comes after several months of serious discussions. The 15 or so people who attended last night's meeting gave the city council and city staff several rounds of exuberant applause as the council signed the resolution that makes the purchase official. One of those in attendance, Ed Werkhoven, took the opportunity to praise those involved with the deal. \"I congratulate everyone for their persistence on this,\" Werkhoven said. \"You found a way for all of us to win.\" The vote to approve the purchase agreement was unanimous by the city council-a rare occurrence considering the volatility and make-up of the group when dealing with major issues in the past. But, there was no conflict last night. All seven of the council members were in whole-hearted accord on the matter. The praise for the deal that was brokered ranged from Councilman Tom Seeger describing last night's actions as \"...a big day for all of us,\" to Mayor Pro-tem George Greenway singling out Rockford as having putting forth a tremendous effort to come to an agreement with the Monson family. Newly appointed Councilman Raul Martinez added his acclaim, citing the efforts of City Attorney Bruce Rinz, as well as Rockford. Martinez also praised the sellers. \"I thank the Monson's for coming to the table (on this agreement),\" Martinez said. Councilwoman Jennie Angel exclaimed she was excited to be a part of this agreement with the Monson family, calling it \"...a great value for the citizens of Alderwood.\" Agreeing with her was Councilman Jim Sarducci, who said it's a wonderful opportunity for the city. \"This is the kind of economic development we need to see,\" he said. Mayor Rex Luthor might have summed it up best, when he said, \"It's truly an investment for the community of Alderwood.\" The feedlot in question has been blamed by many over the years as chiefly responsible for the air quality issues local residents complain of on an almost daily basis. The odor and dust problems are expected to dissipate with the removal of the approximate 2,500-head cattle operation. Some in the community speculate property values, especially those homes on Alderwood's neighboring Harrison Hill, will increase once the westside corridor into Alderwood has been transformed into a business or industrial district. Local realtor Hank Timmermans, though, isn't so sure local residents will see the value of their homes increase. \"I don't foresee any large increases in property values,\" Timmermans hesitantly answered when contacted this morning, adding that he was caught off-guard by the inquiry. Timmermans did explain that the Lower Alderwood Valley area is comprised chiefly of moderate to low income families, and he doesn't believe there will ever be a large market for higher priced homes. He said if property values were to rise too much, most people living in the area would be unable to afford the purchase of higher priced homes. Kenny Nelson of DK Bain Real Estate Inc. agreed with Timmermans that residential property values probably won't rise in Alderwood as a result of the elimination of the dust and odor problems. \"But the quality of life will definitely be a major improvement,\" Nelson said emphatically. \"Maybe people will start looking at moving to Alderwood instead of looking to move into Grandview or Zillah"}

Wednesday morning, Tourism and Promotions Director for the Alderwood Chamber of Commerce Kathy Corliss explained to Rotary Club members that the chamber is currently working to redefine its goals, looking specifically at what the group hopes to accomplish in the next five to 10 years. One example of the chamber's efforts was this year's Sunshine Days festival. Corliss said the chamber decided to try something different this year, whittling the usual three-day event into a one-day affair, because Sunshine Days had been changing and morphing over the years into something that was almost unrecognizable. \"We want to get our hands around it and fix it or create something completely different,\" Corliss said. Corliss noted that one of the most exciting events she was able to be a part of over the past year was Spring Fling Fest. She explained that the festival is a collaborative effort involving chambers from Benton City to Wapato, that is meant to capitalize on spring barrel tasting. Corliss said over the past few years wineries have begun making spring barrel tasting a two weekend event, with special invitations being sent out to people to come to the wineries the weekend before barrel tasting for more one-on-one attention. Corliss explained that the local chambers have come together to try and fill the week between the two weekends with events that make people want to stay in the Valley for a few extra days. \"That is going to be a great thing,\" Corliss said of the Spring Fling Fest. Corliss said the next event Alderwood has to look forward to this year is the Lighted Farm Implement Parade. She told Rotarians that although this is already a great event, the chamber is looking at ways it can be improved. Corliss noted that the chamber is hoping to get more downtown businesses involved in lighting this year, and that the parade will return to ending at the Mid-Valley Mall parking lot as opposed to the parking lot at Alderwood High School, where the parade finished last year. Another change will move the award ceremony for the parade before the event, meaning that award winners can be announced while the entries head down the parade route. Following the parade, Corliss said the next big chamber event is the community awards banquet. \"This is a fantastic time for the community to come together,\" Corliss said. She noted that there are now 10 award categories, including new business. Corliss then encouraged Rotary members to attend the annual Cinco de Mayo festival, which takes place in May. She said last year the event brought in nearly 25,000 people over the course of the weekend. The final chamber event Corliss talked about was the three-on-three basketball tournament, which is held during the fourth weekend of July. Corliss said the chamber is hoping to move the event from the Mid-Valley Mall parking lot to the downtown area.

Just a few days ago a fellow citizen stole my 4'x8' \"Bush for President\" sign in an attempt to, I guess, hide the fact that some people in Washington state will be voting for the President. I am hoping that the person, who undoubtedly is a proponent of free speech as am I, will return the sign with no questions asked.

God bless. /s/ Calvary Lutheran School staff Rekindle spiritin Sunshine Days I wish to thank everyone who was involved with the honor of my being elected grand marshal of the Sunshine Days Parade this year. I do not think you can realize what that meant to me and my family. It was a long time ago when I arrived in Alderwood, 1937 to be exact. A skinny 11-year-old boy and not knowing anyone here. My dad died four months later at age 50 after getting pneumonia from working in the fields, and Mom took her bunch of hungry kids and made a living any way we could. We worked in the fields and it did not hurt us any more than it is today. I have seen Alderwood bloom forward into a proud community by the sweat of many brows, the constitution of the dedicated, the blood of so many young men and faith of what it could become. I have also seen these dreams die and waver, being replaced with desires of others and overshadowing the original ones. I have seen a community lose its faith in the past and uncertain of its future. I remember the days when the Color Guard and service men marched proudly down our streets in front of our high school band in great spirit and pride. The whole town cheering and waving and having a day of family fun. It is sad to think that the era of community spirit is coming to an end. The meaning and memory of how our town was built and why it was built will soon be forgotten and replaced with new ideas not familiar to the founders and their families. I thank you again for this wonderful honor you gave me for it means more to me than you can imagine. And with this, I want to plead with you to find the community spirit that is still alive in the hearts of those who live here and keep our Sunshine Days alive. Give our kids something to remember in later years. Find the reason it was started and use that as the basis to rekindle the interest. I do not think you will regret it. /s/ Don and Ruth Bones and family, Alderwood Harvest Dancea huge success Alderwood Parks and Recreation wants to thank all those who helped make the 2004 Harvest Dance, held on Sunday, Oct. 3, a huge success.

{"Id":"1101162688423","Title":"Guest Editorial","Author":"Webmaster","Time":"10/6/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"DON C. BRUNELL Just a few years ago, another major water war was brewing on the Little Walla Walla River. Rather than farmers and ranchers fighting over water for crops or cattle, it was shaping up to be a battle between the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation and orchardists over water for fish or apples. Anxious to avoid the consequences from the listing of salmon, steelhead and bull trout under the Endangered Species Act, some forward thinkers formed the Walla Walla Watershed Alliance to solve the problem of who gets water and when. The Little Walla Walla River flows from the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon and crosses the state line just west of Walla Walla, joining Mill Creek to form the Walla Walla River. When June and Clark explored the Walla Walla drainage on their return trip to St. Louis in 1806, salmon and steelhead runs abounded in the rivers and their tributaries. But as farmers and ranchers settled in the area, water was diverted for crops, and today the drainage is covered with orchards of Fuji apples, fields of Walla Walla sweet onions, world-class wine grape vineyards, rolling golden hills of grain and pastures of livestock. The bottom line is, until a couple of years ago, salmon and steelhead runs were threatened because there wasn't enough water flowing to allow the fish to migrate to and from the ocean. But Walla Walla had a couple of things going for it. First, the Umatilla Tribe and irrigators realized they were in a no-win situation if they drew a line in the sand and hired an army of lawyers to fight it out in court. The battle would be lengthy and costly, and in the meantime, more fish runs would be depleted. Second, the Umatillas were successfully working on cooperative projects on the Umatilla River just over the hills from the Little Walla Walla and spring Chinook were returning to the river after a 70-year absence. Third, Walla Walla is home to Nelson Irrigation Corp., a forward thinking company recognized worldwide for its innovative water-conserving lawn and agriculture sprinkler systems. The company had water conservation technology and was committed to using its knowledge and techniques in finding solutions to the water problems. Finally, apple growers like Ron Brown in neighboring Milton-Freewater, Ore. reached out to the Umatilla Tribe and formed partnerships. Today, the Walla Walla Watershed Alliance has completed fish passage projects and developed systems to recharge underground aquifers. By recharging nature's underground water system, natural springs are starting to flow again, helping to feed the Little Walla Walla River when it needs water most for fish. While all the elements for success are in place, the Alliance still has to weave its way through the maze of local, state and federal regulations and find funds to continue its work. No doubt it will, because the spirit of cooperation and the will to succeed, evident in Walla Walla, is contagious. It is an example for us all. Don C. Brunell is President of the Association of Washington Business"}
{"Id":"1101162688673","Title":"Grandview Council opts to back off on scooter restrictions","Author":"Ellie Olmsen","Time":"10/5/2004","Tag":null,"Content":"GRANDVIEW - What started out the night as a fairly restrictive motorized scooter ordinance that would have banned anyone without a driver's license from driving the vehicles and would have prohibited the scooters from being driven on downtown streets, may end up making Grandview one of the more scooter friendly towns in the Valley. After listening to several parents in attendance at the meeting, council members sent City Attorney Jack Maxwell back to the drawing board, again. The council has looked at the scooter ordinance during several of its past meetings. The ordinance council members had set in front of them Monday night required motorized scooter operators to follow the rules of the road, restricted the vehicles from being operated in the downtown business district, as well as in parks, on sidewalks and on streets with a posted speed limit of more than 25 miles per hour. It also banned scooters from being operated on several main arterial streets, including Wine Country and Euclid roads, as well as Second and Fifth streets. The ordinance also required scooter riders to have a valid driver's license, therefore putting an age limit on who can operate the vehicles. The ordinance required riders to wear a helmet, and have their vehicle equipped with lights and reflectors. The proposed ordinance also required scooters to have brakes and mufflers. Two of the parents who attended the meeting had children who are not old enough to have a driver's license, but whom the parents feel are responsible enough to be trusted on the scooters. John Rinehart said his 11-year-old son has an electric scooter, which is capable of going about 10 to 12 miles-per-hour, and it's something that he rides for fun. Rinehart said he trusts his son on the scooter, and noted that if the city passed the ordinance the way it was written council would basically be taking his son's toy away. Melodie Wells said her 15-year-old daughter uses her electric scooter to drive herself to and from soccer practice, noting that she uses it specifically, because she doesn't have a drivers license. \"I think requiring a license is going too far,\" Wells said. Wells noted that she requires her daughter to be safe on the scooter, adding that she must wear a helmet while riding. Councilman Rick McLean added that if council was going to limit the age of someone who can legally drive a scooter in Grandview to 16, then those people should be able to ride their scooters anywhere in town that the speed limit is 25 miles-per-hour or less. He didn't like the idea of prohibiting the vehicles in the downtown corridor or on any of the arterial streets. Mayor Mike Bren agreed with McLean, asking that the street restrictions be taken out of the ordinance. He then asked council members what their thoughts were in regards to allowing those with driver's licenses to legally ride the scooters anywhere in town, but also giving younger riders a chance to become legal scooter riders. He said one of the main concerns in regards to these scooters is that the drivers are often too young to know the rules of the road. Bren suggested that perhaps younger riders with electric scooters could attend a safety course taught by the local police department, which would then certify the younger riders, making it possible for them to ride on the road. He added that those who have taken a driver's education course, but have yet to receive their license, could also be certified to ride in Grandview. \"So we're enabling them to ride, enabling them to learn the rules of the road,\" Bren said. The motorized scooter ordinance was tabled by council and will be revisited after the safety course provision has been added, as well as changes that do not limit the streets on which the scooters can be operated"}

Officers arrived within minutes and found Ford running from the market through the Apex winery property. He was chased down on foot by two police officers. Police said the check at first looked to be good, however upon closer examination officers determined the check to be a fake. Ford's identification was also fake, said Hernandez. Ford was booked into the Alderwood jail on charges of forgery, criminal impersonation and resisting arrest. He is expected to be arraigned in Yakima County Superior Court this week.

The Othello Huskies pinned a whopping defeat on the Greyhound football team during Grandview Homecoming this past Friday. The Huskies (2-1, 3-2) rolled into Grandview and escaped town with a 49-14 victory. \"Othello is very young this year,\" said Grandview's first year coach, Dustin Lamb. \"What's surprising is how tough they are.\" The Huskies are also very balanced on offense. Othello rushed for 217 yards against the 'Hounds and picked up another 205 yards through the air. The end result was a pounding of the 'Hounds. One of the few bright spots Lamb could garner from Friday's Central Washington Athletic Conference game was the play of senior Silas Hansen. The talented running back rushed for a team high 135 yards on 22 carries. Hansen also scored both of Grandview's touchdowns. Part of the reason for Hansen's success on the ground was the realignment of Grandview's offensive line. J.R. Camacho and Blake Carpenter were moved to the left side of the line, and the duo opened some gaping holes for Hansen to rush through. \"Camacho and Carpenter's play kind of kick-started us,\" said Lamb. Grandview's undoing was turnovers. On the Greyhounds' first four possessions of the game, they coughed up the ball four times. \"You can't commit those kinds of mistakes against a team as good as Othello,\" said Lamb, \"Not if you expect to win.\" Offensively for Grandview, Brandon Artz threw for 112 yards on 13-of-27 passing numbers. Hansen had five receptions for 25 yards, James Vela hauled in four of the passes for 47 yards and Kevin Concienne tallied 29 yards on three catches. On the defensive side of the ball for Grandview, Camacho was in on 11 tackles, five of them solo stops. Concienne, Artz and Vela each had three solo tackles, with Concienne and Chris Mejia each recording five defensive assists. The Greyhounds (1-2, 1-4) are scheduled to travel to Naches (1-1, 4-1) this coming Friday night"}
